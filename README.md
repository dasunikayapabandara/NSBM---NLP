## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer reviews of unlocked mobile phones from Amazon using various **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  

The main objective was to apply and demonstrate the following NLP methods learned in the module:

- Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization)  
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF vectorization)  
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging & Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
- Topic Modelling (LDA + pyLDAvis visualization)  
- Sentiment Analysis (VADER)  
- Dimensionality reduction & clustering (PCA, UMAP, Hierarchical clustering, K-Means)

**Dataset**  
- Source: [Amazon Reviews: Unlocked Mobile Phones](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/amazon-reviews-unlocked-mobile-phones)  
- Subset used: 5,000 randomly sampled reviews (for computational feasibility)
