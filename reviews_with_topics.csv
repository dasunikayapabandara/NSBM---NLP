Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone,Nokia,59.95,2,"I needed a texting phone that did not require a data plan. I also needed a Nokia as they have the best antenna and can get out when other cell phones can't. Buyer beware! This phone is very difficult to use. It locks after a few seconds of non-use and that can't be turned off! The screen goes dark after only a few seconds of non-use and that too can not be changed. It literally took hours to figure out how to use this phone. An example: I needed to find the call log. After searching forever I finally stumbled across it under contacts. Now that makes sense, why didn't I think of that. The same problem occurred when trying to change the ring tone. Don't bother looking under settings. The only good thing about the phone is that it does get out almost everywhere.

I have to lower the settings nearly all the way so I don't blind myself. I see this as a good thing since I know I have an option to go brighter.-I haven't experienced any issues making a call over wi-fi or through the network, and texting and email works fine as well.-The fingerprint scanner works well, but sometimes too well and I accidentally unlock the phone when sliding it in my pocket.-Charging with the USB Type-C connector has been quick and easy. Google provided a standard USB to USB Type-C cable when I signed up for Fi which really helps.Cons:-I rarely have any hangups when accessing an app, but they happen. Luckily if something freezes up I can turn off the screen and wait a few seconds, which usually does the trick. Usually it's the camera, but I don't care much for taking pictures.-The fingerprint scanner can be a pain when grabbing the phone just to pick it up and not unlock it. You don't have to use it so it's not a big issue.-There are times when the lock screen turns on without touching of the phone or power and volume buttons, and it can be annoying.-The USB Type-C connector that was included with the phone could only be used with the AC adapter since both ends are Type-C.I've been using the phone since January and I have no significant complaints for the overall function of the phone.",1.0,my purpose for getting a phone is to talk text and email so when i moved to the x on google project fi i had hopes that it would outperform my previous phone and network moto e on republic wireless for basic function pros the screen is clear and bright too bright i have to lower the settings nearly all the way so i don t blind myself i see this as a good thing since i know i have an option to go brighter i haven t experienced any issues making a call over wi fi or through the network and texting and email works fine as well the fingerprint scanner works well but sometimes too well and i accidentally unlock the phone when sliding it in my pocket charging with the usb type c connector has been quick and easy google provided a standard usb to usb type c cable when i signed up for fi which really helps cons i rarely have any hangups when accessing an app but they happen luckily if something freezes up i can turn off the screen and wait a few seconds which usually does the trick usually it s the camera but i don t care much for taking pictures the fingerprint scanner can be a pain when grabbing the phone just to pick it up and not unlock it you don t have to use it so it s not a big issue there are times when the lock screen turns on without touching of the phone or power and volume buttons and it can be annoying the usb type c connector that was included with the phone could only be used with the ac adapter since both ends are type c i ve been using the phone since january and i have no significant complaints for the overall function of the phone,purpose get phone talk text email move x google project fi hope outperform previous phone network moto e republic wireless basic function pro screen clear bright bright lower setting nearly way don t blind good thing know option bright haven t experience issue make wi fi network texting email work fine fingerprint scanner work accidentally unlock phone slide pocket charge usb type c connector quick easy google provide standard usb usb type c cable sign fi help con rarely hangup access app happen luckily freeze turn screen wait second usually trick usually s camera don t care take picture fingerprint scanner pain grab phone pick unlock don t use s big issue time lock screen turn touch phone power volume button annoy usb type c connector include phone ac adapter end type c ve phone january significant complaint overall function phone,4,0.656,Overall Experience

I'm Sodom in the process of getting to know the phone but so far no issues with the user interface. The colors are really sharp and the resolution is excellent. Samsung smart switch app allowed me to transfer all my info from my S4 to my S6 edge in and in approximately 10 minutes I was up and running with no issues.In the 2 days that I've had the phone it had sustained one fall from a 2 feet surface (my heart sank) but I'm happy to report that she is still functioning optimally.She feels nice and compact in my hand although the sleek shape makes it feel like she might slip out of my hand.

"BLU Dash M - 5.0"" Smartphone - US GSM Unlocked - White",BLU,69.96,1,"I loved the idea of being able to purchase an affordable phone from someone other than a cell phone provider in attempt to get around the ATT scam of the ""Next"" plan which is basically a rent to own program resulting in the customer paying $400-$500 dollars for older out of date phones. So I bought 2 of these phones for my parents, the phones look good and are fairly easy to use. Unfortunately they do not work, many times a day fail to receive either phones calls or text messages. The person calling is immediately directed to voicemail and the person using the phone is completely unaware that someone is trying to contact them. What makes it worse is the person using the phone can call or text fine, so they think the phone is functioning normally. The only way to correct the problem is to reboot the phone. When you reboot the phone you see you missed phone calls and text messages. This issue is happens multiple times per day. We have tried every thing we can to correct the problem including software updates and new sim cards. Both phones are having this issue so I feel pretty confident it is a phone issue.

I had been considering making the jump for some time, but I had yet to find an Android phone that matched the build quality and performance of my iPhone 6S. The z5 Compact finally did convinced me.Pros:+ Same size screen as the iPhone 6S, despite being smaller and lighter.+ Excellent build quality - the phone feels premium, solid and well made. I don't worry about anything breaking if I drop it once or twice.+ Waterproof!+ Very little manufacturer bloatware, especially compared to Samsung or LG. Among other things, this means that future Android updates will hit this phone sooner than many other Android devices.+ I actually most of the bloatware that's included. Sony's launcher is fast and responsive - I'm actually using it instead of the official Google launcher.+ Camera is high quality.+ Better battery life than my iPhone 6s+ Fingerprint scanner+ Plenty of processing power - I haven't yet seen the phone slow down or choke on any app I've thrown at it.Cons:- Cases options for this phone in the U.S. are limited when compared to the dancing plethora of iPhone cases that flood every electronics store, website, gas station and grocery store.- Because this is the international version of the phone, there's no warranty- Because this is the international version of the phone, some apps think I'm in Ireland. I'm sure a simple setting could easily change this, but I haven't yet found it.- Fingerprint scanner doesn't work as well as iPhone 6S (though it's still good). I think this is mainly due to the fact that the scanner is smaller than the iPhone scanner, so it has less to work with.Overall, I've found this phone to be the perfect fit for me.

Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini G800F 16GB Unlocked Cellphone - International Version (Black),Samsung,239.0,4,"I was using a Samsung Galaxy S2 for a few years. Running on only 1GB ram with 8GB memory, it was no longer able to keep up with my daily functions. So I bought this S5 mini. At first, I was nervous about only going up to 1.5GB of ram (the S5 and S6 have a 2.0 RAM and other phones go as high as 4.0GB). But the phone runs very quick. I make sure to have up to 3 applications running at a given time to ensure I have the best experience. Either way, I clear out my used application list frequently. I love how small the mini is compared to it's counterpart (S5). I feel like this is the best of both worlds in terms of having the full functionality of the S5 or S6 but it is still easy to transport and use.My main issues with this phone are:1) The product description doesn't specify that you need a micro SIM card. Once my phone arrived and my old sim didn't fit into the new phone that's how I found out. Had it specify it, I would'ev clicked the add on when adding the phone to my cart.2) The phone provides very cool emojis within its keyboard. However, no one is able to see any emoji I send. I keep getting an error message every type I send one out (see the image I included with this review). My friend with an S4 says she gets ""??"" every time I send an emoji. My friend with an S6 says he just sees a space. However, when anyone sends me an emoji (all types of androids) I can always see it. It sucks how they can express themselves fully via emojis but I can't! I was forced to only send the green android emoji faces. I eventually had to download an app just to send emojis even though my samsung keyboard has the same emojis I am downloading. We all even updated our software to the latest one and it still fails. It doesn't make any sense!3) Some areas of my apartment has little to no service (even though I am in a ""highly covered area"" in the USA). On my S2, I relied on wi-fi calling to carry out 99.9% of my indoor calls. This phone doesn't allow wi-fi calling, at least, not with the micro-sim card it requires to have. So now I am back to stretching my head as close to the window just to get one bar of signal.4) When transferring my files from an S2 to an S5 mini, I noticed not all of my memos moved over. I had a couple of memos that were passcode locked to protect private info. Apparently the S5 mini doesn't support ""locked"" memos so it doesn't even show them. Now I am in the process of figuring out what to do instead because I still need that info!",3.0,i was using a samsung galaxy s for a few years running on only gb ram with gb memory it was no longer able to keep up with my daily functions so i bought this s mini at first i was nervous about only going up to gb of ram the s and s have a ram and other phones go as high as gb but the phone runs very quick i make sure to have up to applications running at a given time to ensure i have the best experience either way i clear out my used application list frequently i love how small the mini is compared to it s counterpart s i feel like this is the best of both worlds in terms of having the full functionality of the s or s but it is still easy to transport and use my main issues with this phone are the product description doesn t specify that you need a micro sim card once my phone arrived and my old sim didn t fit into the new phone that s how i found out had it specify it i would ev clicked the add on when adding the phone to my cart the phone provides very cool emojis within its keyboard however no one is able to see any emoji i send i keep getting an error message every type i send one out see the image i included with this review my friend with an s says she gets every time i send an emoji my friend with an s says he just sees a space however when anyone sends me an emoji all types of androids i can always see it it sucks how they can express themselves fully via emojis but i can t i was forced to only send the green android emoji faces i eventually had to download an app just to send emojis even though my samsung keyboard has the same emojis i am downloading we all even updated our software to the latest one and it still fails it doesn t make any sense some areas of my apartment has little to no service even though i am in a highly covered area in the usa on my s i relied on wi fi calling to carry out of my indoor calls this phone doesn t allow wi fi calling at least not with the micro sim card it requires to have so now i am back to stretching my head as close to the window just to get one bar of signal when transferring my files from an s to an s mini i noticed not all of my memos moved over i had a couple of memos that were passcode locked to protect private info apparently the s mini doesn t support locked memos so it doesn t even show them now i am in the process of figuring out what to do instead because i still need that info,samsung galaxy s year run gb ram gb memory long able daily function buy s mini nervous go gb ram s s ram phone high gb phone run quick sure application run give time ensure good experience way clear application list frequently love small mini compare s counterpart s feel like good world term have functionality s s easy transport use main issue phone product description doesn t specify need micro sim card phone arrive old sim didn t fit new phone s find specify ev click add add phone cart phone provide cool emoji keyboard able emoji send get error message type send image include review friend s say get time send emoji friend s say see space send emoji type android suck express fully emoji t force send green android emoji face eventually download app send emoji samsung keyboard emoji download update software late fail doesn t sense area apartment little service highly cover area usa s rely wi fi call carry indoor call phone doesn t allow wi fi call micro sim card require stretch head close window bar signal transfer file s s mini notice memo move couple memo passcode lock protect private info apparently s mini doesn t support lock memo doesn t process figure instead need info,4,0.7,Overall Experience

"Nokia C3-00 Unlocked Cell Phone (Slate) with QWERTY, Dedicated E-mail Key, 2 MP Camera, Media Player, WLAN, and MicroSD Slot",Nokia,49.99,1,"If I can rate this defective cell phone with Zero Star, I would give it Zero-star, but I think my only option is to rate it 1-star. Just like the Prior Unhappy Buyer of this Same device did a few months ago, I have to return this crappy cell phone to the UPS store tomorrow morning (Jan 6, 2012) for a 100% refund. I'll explain below how I know there is a Prior Unhappy Buyer of this defective Cell Phone.Today (Jan 5, 2012), I'm extremely disappointed about 5 minutes after I opened the package. First, I noticed a PRIOR UNHAPPY BUYER returned this piece of crap, defective cell phone in October 2011 (just a few months before me). The ""Return due to Defective Product"" notice dated in October 2011 was still attached to the package sent to me. The seller is Warehouse Deals, Inc which is a subsidiary of Amazon. The seller Warehouse Deals, Inc must be thinking that if the Nokia C3-00 is defective in one unhappy buyer's eyes, it must not be defective in the next buyer's eyes. HELLO! Defective is defective - it means internally mal-functioning, it's not merely external/superficial beauty in the eyes of the beholder.I have owned several older Nokia cell phone models, so I began testing several functions. Immediately, I noticed that the Right and Left Key (just above the alpha & numeric keyboards) are not responsive when I try to select on-screen options. The only time the Right key works is when switching on/off the device. I gave my benefit of the doubt by pressing the key at different strength: hard, medium and soft, but nothing worked. Then I immediately went to online chat with Nokia online support to explain my problems with this device. The Nokia online support confirm what I know about Nokia devices from my own experience, that it is NOT normal for the Right and Left Key not to be responsive to on-screen selections (in other words, I wouldn't need to press more than 1 key to pick on-screen selections). On all my prior Nokia cell phone, you only need to press 1-key (either the Right or Left key to select your on-screen option).I've had a string of bad luck ordering this Nokia C3-00 unlocked cell phone (a very long story, prior to receiving this defective cell phone, I made at least 3 telephone complaints about an Amazon Rep. called Amit Y. who made unauthorized cancellation on 2 good, valid and in-stock orders without my permission. This is really testing my patience on purchasing electronic devices from Amazon.

Just as the previous one I lost in a crowd after a couple of years' heavy use, I expect this one to last me for the foreseeable future.

"ASUS ZenFone 2 Laser Unlocked Smartphone, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage",ASUS Computers,229.0,4,"EDIT:I installed the Marshmallow update several weeks ago, and I've had zero problems with the phone since. It seems to have solved my Bluetooth issues; if anything it's now TOO persistent - the Zenfone Laser won't allow my LG G4 to connect to audio in my car if it's still on. So, install the Marshmallow update, and you'll have a really good, 4 star mid-range phone. Overall, I'm glad I bought it, it's still not quite as good as my LG G4 overall but I paid half as much for it - IMO it's worth more than that.Original Review:I got the unlocked 32gb Zenphone 2 Laser with 3gb memory. I wanted a dual SIM solution because T-Mobile has service at my work and AT&T has service everywhere else; unfortunately it's not a seamless solution because of T-Mobiles weird restrictions (no call forwarding? In 2016?). Unfortunately the phone is also crippled by Bluetooth connection problems so severe I've been forced to relegate it to work-only duty; if you want to use car BT connections routinely you will have to look elsewhere.Pros:- Screen is bright, clear. Honestly, can't tell it's not 1080p.- reasonably fast and responsive (3 gb memory version). Plays games like zombies v. plants without a hitch.- works well with AT&T, T-Mobile.- memory card slot accepted 128gb card without a hiccup.- camera is ok, not near as good as my LG G4 but much better than my old iphone 5 and Nexus 4. Nice features in the Zen camera app like HDR and manual controls.- ZenUI interface not bad, quite usable, fairly light skinning.- suite of Zen software has some useful tools, easy to disable.- marshmallow update available (but reported to be buggy, so haven't installed it yet).- battery lasts all day with light-moderate use.Cons:- Bluetooth issues - read around on Reddit about ongoing BT problems with Zenphones. Not a good choice if car BT is essential to you. In one car I own I have to stop and restart BT on the phone to get it to connect (sometimes, not consistently; drops off and on); in the other vehicle I have to turn the whole car off and on.... don't get me started on my BT speaker....- the replaceable battery is only available as a kit with a charger directly from ASUS; no battery-only or aftermarket battery solutions. So pricey, and with extra baggage.- speaker is ok but earphone volume is low, usually have to keep it on max volume - but I can listen at 50% on most other phones.- no Qualcomm quickcharge, takes several hours to recharge from empty with a 2.1A charger.- gets quite warm with GPS use and when streaming music, not as bad as iphone 5 or Nexus 4 but much worse than LG G4.- several minor niggles that are mostly me; I don't like the full-time capacitive touch buttons (not upgradeable) or the lack of NFC.Overall, not a bad phone, but BT issues are a serious problem that could possibly be remedied with a software update; I have no idea why they haven't fixed it yet. I haven't heard they are fixed in Marshmallow; once it's stable I will find out.",1.0,edit i installed the marshmallow update several weeks ago and i ve had zero problems with the phone since it seems to have solved my bluetooth issues if anything it s now too persistent the zenfone laser won t allow my lg g to connect to audio in my car if it s still on so install the marshmallow update and you ll have a really good star mid range phone overall i m glad i bought it it s still not quite as good as my lg g overall but i paid half as much for it imo it s worth more than that original review i got the unlocked gb zenphone laser with gb memory i wanted a dual sim solution because t mobile has service at my work and at t has service everywhere else unfortunately it s not a seamless solution because of t mobiles weird restrictions no call forwarding in unfortunately the phone is also crippled by bluetooth connection problems so severe i ve been forced to relegate it to work only duty if you want to use car bt connections routinely you will have to look elsewhere pros screen is bright clear honestly can t tell it s not p reasonably fast and responsive gb memory version plays games like zombies v plants without a hitch works well with at t t mobile memory card slot accepted gb card without a hiccup camera is ok not near as good as my lg g but much better than my old iphone and nexus nice features in the zen camera app like hdr and manual controls zenui interface not bad quite usable fairly light skinning suite of zen software has some useful tools easy to disable marshmallow update available but reported to be buggy so haven t installed it yet battery lasts all day with light moderate use cons bluetooth issues read around on reddit about ongoing bt problems with zenphones not a good choice if car bt is essential to you in one car i own i have to stop and restart bt on the phone to get it to connect sometimes not consistently drops off and on in the other vehicle i have to turn the whole car off and on don t get me started on my bt speaker the replaceable battery is only available as a kit with a charger directly from asus no battery only or aftermarket battery solutions so pricey and with extra baggage speaker is ok but earphone volume is low usually have to keep it on max volume but i can listen at on most other phones no qualcomm quickcharge takes several hours to recharge from empty with a a charger gets quite warm with gps use and when streaming music not as bad as iphone or nexus but much worse than lg g several minor niggles that are mostly me i don t like the full time capacitive touch buttons not upgradeable or the lack of nfc overall not a bad phone but bt issues are a serious problem that could possibly be remedied with a software update i have no idea why they haven t fixed it yet i haven t heard they are fixed in marshmallow once it s stable i will find out,edit instal marshmallow update week ago ve zero problem phone solve bluetooth issue s persistent zenfone laser win t allow lg g connect audio car s install marshmallow update ll good star mid range phone overall m glad buy s good lg g overall pay half imo s worth original review get unlocked gb zenphone laser gb memory want dual sim solution t mobile service work t service unfortunately s seamless solution t mobile weird restriction forward unfortunately phone cripple bluetooth connection problem severe ve force relegate work duty want use car bt connection routinely look pro screen bright clear honestly t tell s p reasonably fast responsive gb memory version play game like zombie v plant hitch work t t mobile memory card slot accept gb card hiccup camera ok near good lg g well old iphone nexus nice feature zen camera app like hdr manual control zenui interface bad usable fairly light skin suite zen software useful tool easy disable marshmallow update available report buggy haven t instal battery last day light moderate use con bluetooth issue read reddit ongoing bt problem zenphone good choice car bt essential car stop restart bt phone connect consistently drop vehicle turn car don t start bt speaker replaceable battery available kit charger directly asus battery aftermarket battery solution pricey extra baggage speaker ok earphone volume low usually max volume listen phone qualcomm quickcharge take hour recharge charger get warm gps use streaming music bad iphone nexus bad lg g minor niggle don t like time capacitive touch button upgradeable lack nfc overall bad phone bt issue problem possibly remedie software update idea haven t fix haven t hear fix marshmallow s stable find,1,0.435,Screen & Display

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 64GB - Pearl White - GSM - US Warranty,,349.99,5,"I'm super impressed with this phone. I did a lot of research after being a Samsung guy for many years. I just couldn't justify paying crazy high prices for unlocked phones anymore. Despite some of the cons listed I finally decided to go with the Honor 8. I am not disappointed.You can feel the quality. I'm upgrading from a Galaxy S5 and you can really feel the difference with the Honor's aluminum body from the plastic S5.The phone is super fast, has two great cameras, great battery life (with pretty quick charging), amazing speaker, MicroSD slot, NFC and every other feature I loved with the S5. Plus this phone comes with Android Marshmallow, which has some really great new features.Because of the reviews I read, I was prepared for the EMUI, which is their tweaks to the Android OS. People are not wrong - if you are used to stock Android, the EMUI apps are not great but a few minutes in the Play Store fixed that and the phone allows you to replace the default applications with no hassle. It came with a few preloaded apps that I didn't want but they were easily deleted. Not the same bloatware that most phones come with.Also, the reviews that suggest you buy a case immediately are not wrong. This phone has a super slick surface that slides out of your hand and will literally slide off of a desk or table.My one annoyance right now is that I am unable to plug the phone into my computer and transfer files without installing their installed software. I'm trying to find a workaround but it's a minor inconvenience considering how much I like the phone. The sim and microSD slots are also a bit hard to get to as you have to use a tiny pin tool (included) to pop open the slot.An unlocked Samsung S7 is $549 and the Honor 8 was only $319 so I saved a lot of money and got what I think is an amazing deal. I would recommend this phone with no hesitations.",2.0,i m super impressed with this phone i did a lot of research after being a samsung guy for many years i just couldn t justify paying crazy high prices for unlocked phones anymore despite some of the cons listed i finally decided to go with the honor i am not disappointed you can feel the quality i m upgrading from a galaxy s and you can really feel the difference with the honor s aluminum body from the plastic s the phone is super fast has two great cameras great battery life with pretty quick charging amazing speaker microsd slot nfc and every other feature i loved with the s plus this phone comes with android marshmallow which has some really great new features because of the reviews i read i was prepared for the emui which is their tweaks to the android os people are not wrong if you are used to stock android the emui apps are not great but a few minutes in the play store fixed that and the phone allows you to replace the default applications with no hassle it came with a few preloaded apps that i didn t want but they were easily deleted not the same bloatware that most phones come with also the reviews that suggest you buy a case immediately are not wrong this phone has a super slick surface that slides out of your hand and will literally slide off of a desk or table my one annoyance right now is that i am unable to plug the phone into my computer and transfer files without installing their installed software i m trying to find a workaround but it s a minor inconvenience considering how much i like the phone the sim and microsd slots are also a bit hard to get to as you have to use a tiny pin tool included to pop open the slot an unlocked samsung s is and the honor was only so i saved a lot of money and got what i think is an amazing deal i would recommend this phone with no hesitations,m super impressed phone lot research samsung guy year couldn t justify pay crazy high price unlocked phone anymore despite con list finally decide honor disappoint feel quality m upgrade galaxy s feel difference honor s aluminum body plastic s phone super fast great camera great battery life pretty quick charge amazing speaker microsd slot nfc feature love s plus phone come android marshmallow great new feature review read prepare emui tweak android os people wrong stock android emui app great minute play store fix phone allow replace default application hassle come preloaded app didn t want easily delete bloatware phone come review suggest buy case immediately wrong phone super slick surface slide hand literally slide desk table annoyance right unable plug phone computer transfer file instal instal software m try find workaround s minor inconvenience consider like phone sim microsd slot bit hard use tiny pin tool include pop open slot unlocked samsung s honor save lot money get think amazing deal recommend phone hesitation,4,0.751,Overall Experience

BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - US GSM - White,BLU,101.91,5,"I got this phone at the pre-order price of $79 and it's definitely worth the price. I also bought an Asus Zenfone 2 not long ago and I'll be comparing this Life 8 XL to the ZF2 since the screens are the same size.Hardware:The size is comparable to the ZF2 but is just slightly taller in height. Lots of space is wasted in the bezel but I don't find that to be too crippling in my use. The 8XL is both lighter and thinner than the ZF2, making it more comfortable to hold and use with one hand.The 8XL has a lower resolution display (720p) but I had no problems reading on the 8XL. The display was bright and easily visible under sunlight. The bright orange color makes it look like a kid's toy but I do like the color. Comes with a screen protector already attached and a matching orange case as well.Storage:No problems installing a 16GB microsd card to extend the amount of storage in the phone.Battery life:I've only had the phone for a day so I can't really comment on the battery life but it seems to be alright for now. I'll update when I have a better handle on the battery life.Software:Phone came with almost stock Android Kit Kat 4.4.2 with very little bloatware. The ZF2 in comparison came with over a dozen useless Asus bloatware that I had to remove manually. There's only 1GB of ram but I had no problems with normal usage of apps and browsing the the web with the included Opera browser. No noticeable slow-downs compared to the ZF2 either.Tip: Root the phone using King Root (google for it) and then you can replace the KingUser app with SuperSU by installing the ""SuperSU Me"" app from the playstore. I had no problems installing the Xposed Framework (make sure your runtime is on Dalvik) and customizing the UI with Gravity Box KK.Connectivity:Unlike most other budget phones, Wifi connects to both 2.4GHz and 5.0 GHz networks!. I didn't try out bluetooth so I can't comment on it. I tried out my T-mobile SIM on the phone (Global GSM version) and was only able to connect at HSPA 14.4Mbps speeds. The phone should theoretically be able to do HSPA+ 21Mbps but that is still below the maximum HSPA+ 41Mbps speeds that T-mobile should be able to provide. It is possible that that's the maximum speed for T-Mobile at PCS HSPA+ here in Boston. Higher speeds could possibly be attained with the US GSM version of the phone that provides the 1700 AWS band.FM Radio:To my surprise, the 8XL comes with FM radio (app comes installed) so I could easily listen to the radio by connecting my earphones to the phone.Overall, the phone is a steal for the preorder price especially comparing to the similar but much pricier Zenfone 2. Only real issue was the slower data connection but I already knew that LTE was absent when I ordered the phone. Would have nice if it supported the faster HSPA+ 41Mbps speeds. 21Mbps max speed hardly counts as 4G today!",3.0,i got this phone at the pre order price of and it s definitely worth the price i also bought an asus zenfone not long ago and i ll be comparing this life xl to the zf since the screens are the same size hardware the size is comparable to the zf but is just slightly taller in height lots of space is wasted in the bezel but i don t find that to be too crippling in my use the xl is both lighter and thinner than the zf making it more comfortable to hold and use with one hand the xl has a lower resolution display p but i had no problems reading on the xl the display was bright and easily visible under sunlight the bright orange color makes it look like a kid s toy but i do like the color comes with a screen protector already attached and a matching orange case as well storage no problems installing a gb microsd card to extend the amount of storage in the phone battery life i ve only had the phone for a day so i can t really comment on the battery life but it seems to be alright for now i ll update when i have a better handle on the battery life software phone came with almost stock android kit kat with very little bloatware the zf in comparison came with over a dozen useless asus bloatware that i had to remove manually there s only gb of ram but i had no problems with normal usage of apps and browsing the the web with the included opera browser no noticeable slow downs compared to the zf either tip root the phone using king root google for it and then you can replace the kinguser app with supersu by installing the supersu me app from the playstore i had no problems installing the xposed framework make sure your runtime is on dalvik and customizing the ui with gravity box kk connectivity unlike most other budget phones wifi connects to both ghz and ghz networks i didn t try out bluetooth so i can t comment on it i tried out my t mobile sim on the phone global gsm version and was only able to connect at hspa mbps speeds the phone should theoretically be able to do hspa mbps but that is still below the maximum hspa mbps speeds that t mobile should be able to provide it is possible that that s the maximum speed for t mobile at pcs hspa here in boston higher speeds could possibly be attained with the us gsm version of the phone that provides the aws band fm radio to my surprise the xl comes with fm radio app comes installed so i could easily listen to the radio by connecting my earphones to the phone overall the phone is a steal for the preorder price especially comparing to the similar but much pricier zenfone only real issue was the slower data connection but i already knew that lte was absent when i ordered the phone would have nice if it supported the faster hspa mbps speeds mbps max speed hardly counts as g today,get phone pre order price s definitely worth price buy asus zenfone long ago ll compare life xl zf screen size hardware size comparable zf slightly tall height lot space waste bezel don t find crippling use xl light thin zf make comfortable hold use hand xl low resolution display p problem read xl display bright easily visible sunlight bright orange color make look like kid s toy like color come screen protector attach matching orange case storage problem instal gb microsd card extend storage phone battery life ve phone day t comment battery life alright ll update well handle battery life software phone come stock android kit kat little bloatware zf comparison come dozen useless asus bloatware remove manually s gb ram problem normal usage app browse web include opera browser noticeable slow down compare zf tip root phone king root google replace kinguser app supersu instal supersu app playstore problem instal xpose framework sure runtime dalvik customize ui gravity box kk connectivity unlike budget phone wifi connect ghz ghz network didn t try bluetooth t comment try t mobile sim phone global gsm version able connect hspa mbps speed phone theoretically able hspa mbps maximum hspa mbps speed t mobile able provide possible s maximum speed t mobile pc hspa boston high speed possibly attain gsm version phone provide aw band fm radio surprise xl come fm radio app comes instal easily listen radio connect earphone phone overall phone steal preorder price especially compare similar pricy zenfone real issue slow datum connection know lte absent order phone nice support fast hspa mbps speeds mbps max speed hardly count g today,4,0.437,Overall Experience

"Huawei Mate 8 NXT-L29 32GB Dual SIM Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Grey)",Huawei,425.73,5,"I am really impressed with Huawei. Gone are the days when you would get cheap knock offs with nothing to support behind you. This is not the case for Huawei. They really are making phones that can compete with the current market especially the iPhone. I will say that the phone really is large. Too big for my hand but for my dad it seems like the best phone because of the screen size and how the texts look.One thing really stands out, is the battery life. I'm just a average user and would use the phone for calls or Facebook or light browsing, but even then I was able to last it 2 Days without recharge. That's awesome where my iPhone 6 would last only 8 -11 hours most. Really great battery life.Now regarding the software. EMUI is not exactly typical stock android, it feels more like an iPhone and those coming from an iPhone would find similarities and would be of no difficulty for them, but android users would probably complain of lack of tray etc. people would preferably get away using nova launcher. I'm more of an iPhone user and it suits me well. But your mileage may vary.Cons are that it technically is not suitable for T-Mobile LTE. It would work with 4g well but not LTE. In some locations depending on where you are it may drop to 3G. However, I have experienced near LTE speeds so I'm not going to complain on it. Call quality is good.It's great that it can accept microSD cards up to 128 gb and I love it.The major conn I have is that I got it in the English language but I still get some Chinese messages and can't get rid of it. Secondly I did not have google play store installed and I had to manually download it from the Huawei App Store.

"Smart&Cool® Smart Watch for Android phone,Help you Sending and receiving texts,Phone speaker ,phonebook contacts,control your phone's music,weather report and so on",Smart&Cool,48.0,5,"I wanted something that had basic smartwatch abilities, like letting me know when I was getting a call or incoming message with vibration, but I wanted it to look nice no matter what I wear. There are just not many feminine-looking smartwatches and finding one that really works was hard. I finally decided on this one and I am so happy that I did. First, the shipping was fast. The band is real metal and the clasp fits snug, so it has never came loose. I can adjust the band to be fitting or loose against my wrist, which I also like. I downloaded Smartwatch from Google Playstore, which was recommended by another Amazon customer who had issues with their QR code. It connects and stays connected as long as I am within range. The range is ok. It will disconnect if my phone is on my nightstand charging and I walk to my kitchen, two rooms away, so that isn't bad. It will reconnect again once I go back within range. The sound is ok. The speaker is small, so it isn't terrific, but it is nice for using while I am doing housework if I am away from my BT speaker. Calls are clear and my husband and mom say it sounds clear when I was talking to them. The controls are really simple. The top button turns on the screen. You hold the bottom button to get to the functions. Pushing the bottom button once scrolls through, but only one way. Any feature you want to select, you just hold the button again. It has a few different alarm tones in addition to the vibration or just being silent. The top button goes back one menu. Holding the top button turns the watch on and off. Maybe a little too simplistic, and annoying when you accidentally skip the function you wanted to select, but really, I was not expecting it to be comparable to the iWatch or Samsung Gear. The pedometer only turns on when you want it on, so I do not use that as I have a Fitbit and I forget to switch the pedometer on. All in all, a pretty good watch.It came already programmed in English for me, but to change the language, hold the bottom button, tap the bottom button until you see the tools. The order for this menu is ""Alarm, Profile, Time and Date, Language, Restore Settings"". Hold the bottom button to select ""language"". You should be able to read when it says English, or whatever language you need since it is written in that language's characters. I hope that helps. You also cannot change the time from military time. Another kinda annoying thing, but not that bad. I hope this seller will add the gold color D8 now since I feel good about buying from them.",26.0,i wanted something that had basic smartwatch abilities like letting me know when i was getting a call or incoming message with vibration but i wanted it to look nice no matter what i wear there are just not many feminine looking smartwatches and finding one that really works was hard i finally decided on this one and i am so happy that i did first the shipping was fast the band is real metal and the clasp fits snug so it has never came loose i can adjust the band to be fitting or loose against my wrist which i also like i downloaded smartwatch from google playstore which was recommended by another amazon customer who had issues with their qr code it connects and stays connected as long as i am within range the range is ok it will disconnect if my phone is on my nightstand charging and i walk to my kitchen two rooms away so that isn t bad it will reconnect again once i go back within range the sound is ok the speaker is small so it isn t terrific but it is nice for using while i am doing housework if i am away from my bt speaker calls are clear and my husband and mom say it sounds clear when i was talking to them the controls are really simple the top button turns on the screen you hold the bottom button to get to the functions pushing the bottom button once scrolls through but only one way any feature you want to select you just hold the button again it has a few different alarm tones in addition to the vibration or just being silent the top button goes back one menu holding the top button turns the watch on and off maybe a little too simplistic and annoying when you accidentally skip the function you wanted to select but really i was not expecting it to be comparable to the iwatch or samsung gear the pedometer only turns on when you want it on so i do not use that as i have a fitbit and i forget to switch the pedometer on all in all a pretty good watch it came already programmed in english for me but to change the language hold the bottom button tap the bottom button until you see the tools the order for this menu is alarm profile time and date language restore settings hold the bottom button to select language you should be able to read when it says english or whatever language you need since it is written in that language s characters i hope that helps you also cannot change the time from military time another kinda annoying thing but not that bad i hope this seller will add the gold color d now since i feel good about buying from them,want basic smartwatch ability like let know get incoming message vibration want look nice matter wear feminine look smartwatche find work hard finally decide happy shipping fast band real metal clasp fit snug come loose adjust band fitting loose wrist like download smartwatch google playstore recommend amazon customer issue qr code connect stay connect long range range ok disconnect phone nightstand charging walk kitchen room away isn t bad reconnect range sound ok speaker small isn t terrific nice housework away bt speaker call clear husband mom sound clear talk control simple button turn screen hold button function push button scroll way feature want select hold button different alarm tone addition vibration silent button go menu hold button turn watch maybe little simplistic annoying accidentally skip function want select expect comparable iwatch samsung gear pedometer turn want use fitbit forget switch pedometer pretty good watch came program english change language hold button tap button tool order menu alarm profile time date language restore setting hold button select language able read say english language need write language s character hope help change time military time kinda annoying thing bad hope seller add gold color d feel good buy,4,0.767,Overall Experience

LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - Mint 16GB (U.S. Warranty),LG,449.0,5,"My three month old Moto X Pure was stolen, so I bought this one instead. This review will center around comparing the two, as they are in very similar price points. I prefer this phone to the Motorola, by a slight margin.The pros:- The size is smaller, which makes it easier to manipulate. It still is a big phone, bigger than a Moto G- It is much lighter. The difference is significant when in the pocket- Fingerprint scanner is very practical and useful to unlock the device. I thought it would be a gimmick, but it is not- The screen is brighter and has better color calibration- The main camera takes better pictures- The screen is high resolution enough (HD) while not waisting battery or processing power in pushing pixels I can't see (QHD)- Slightly faster, even though it has 1 GB less of RAM. I installed all updates right away, which may explain why I'm not seeing the performance bottlenecks some other reviewers are talking about.- Faster software updates- Easier to repair (not much glue to hold it together)The cons:- The selfie camera doesn't have as wideangle a lens as on the Moto X- No one I know has a USB C charger. Make sure you have enough battery when you leave your house!- The plastic construction has very slight creaking sounds when handling it sometimes, which is annoying (reminds me of Nokia dumbphones of yore, not that they were not durable). The Motorola felt like a solid brick. This is explained by the fact that the Motorola is glued together, while this one has a more traditional construction.- The Moto X has an SD card slot and Android 6.0's adoptable storage makes it seem like internal memory to the user, which is great. You're stuck with what you bought with the Nexus.The same:- Battery life is just as bad on this as it is on the Moto X (or any other 2015 phone). I miss my old Moto G's amazing battery life- Fast charging is just as fast and convenient on both- Network reception, call quality and modem speed seem on par",10.0,my three month old moto x pure was stolen so i bought this one instead this review will center around comparing the two as they are in very similar price points i prefer this phone to the motorola by a slight margin the pros the size is smaller which makes it easier to manipulate it still is a big phone bigger than a moto g it is much lighter the difference is significant when in the pocket fingerprint scanner is very practical and useful to unlock the device i thought it would be a gimmick but it is not the screen is brighter and has better color calibration the main camera takes better pictures the screen is high resolution enough hd while not waisting battery or processing power in pushing pixels i can t see qhd slightly faster even though it has gb less of ram i installed all updates right away which may explain why i m not seeing the performance bottlenecks some other reviewers are talking about faster software updates easier to repair not much glue to hold it together the cons the selfie camera doesn t have as wideangle a lens as on the moto x no one i know has a usb c charger make sure you have enough battery when you leave your house the plastic construction has very slight creaking sounds when handling it sometimes which is annoying reminds me of nokia dumbphones of yore not that they were not durable the motorola felt like a solid brick this is explained by the fact that the motorola is glued together while this one has a more traditional construction the moto x has an sd card slot and android s adoptable storage makes it seem like internal memory to the user which is great you re stuck with what you bought with the nexus the same battery life is just as bad on this as it is on the moto x or any other phone i miss my old moto g s amazing battery life fast charging is just as fast and convenient on both network reception call quality and modem speed seem on par,month old moto x pure steal buy instead review center compare similar price point prefer phone motorola slight margin pro size small make easy manipulate big phone big moto g light difference significant pocket fingerprint scanner practical useful unlock device think gimmick screen bright well color calibration main camera take well picture screen high resolution hd waiste battery processing power push pixel t qhd slightly fast gb ram instal update right away explain m see performance bottleneck reviewer talk fast software update easy repair glue hold con selfie camera doesn t wideangle lens moto x know usb c charger sure battery leave house plastic construction slight creaking sound handle annoying remind nokia dumbphone yore durable motorola feel like solid brick explain fact motorola glue traditional construction moto x sd card slot android s adoptable storage make like internal memory user great stick buy nexus battery life bad moto x phone miss old moto g s amazing battery life fast charging fast convenient network reception quality modem speed par,4,0.894,Overall Experience

"Nokia Lumia 800 Unlocked GSM Phone with Windows 7.5 OS, 3.7"" AMOLED Multi-Touchscreen, 8MP Camera with Carl Zeiss Optics, Video, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and FM Radio - Black",,99.95,5,"UPDATE #3: I just realized I completely forgot to mention certain carrier info. I'm using the phone with AT&T in NYC. Doesn't work with their HSPA+ (yet? I believe there will be a way to enable the frequency) as far as I can tell but I get 3mbit downstream and 1mbit upstream, which is a-OK.UPDATE #2: Flashed the new 11501 firmware. Battery problem be gone! I unplugged my phone at around 1AM and left it idling. It's now 330PM and battery still at 58% with normal use from 9AM. Great job Nokia. I haven't noticed anything else other than the battery fix though. Added the last star :)-------------------------------------------------------You can love or hate Windows Phone OS, but you have to admit, Nokia sure stepped up their game in designing this beauty.HARDWARE:""Borrowed"" heavily from its N9 sibling, this is one stunning phone to look at. Poly-carbonate body means very scratch resistant and none of that slippery glass surface, unlike a certain smartphone. The curves also make it very comfortable to hold, especially over a long period of time, also unlike a certain square-ish phone. Speaker and microphone neatly at the bottom while micro USB port and sim slot are at the top.The screen is amazing. The 3.7"" Clearblack LCD (aka Super AMOLED or whatever you want to call it) gives you such vibrant colors that my retina-display iPhone 4 looks like a last-gen screen next to it, at least in terms of colors and contrasts. The touchscreen is very sensitive, though I've noticed it can be a bit jumpy at times. No idea if it's a software or hardware problem, or just my screen protector.The only problems I have with the designs are: a) the dedicated camera button. It's a two-stage shutter (slightly press to focus and fully to shoot) is a bit flimsy. b) the micro-USB port cover flips up and can easily be broken. And it stays this way while connected. (This has been remedied with the upcoming Lumia 900 btw.)Overall, this is the best looking phone I've seen in years. Kudos to Nokia for trying something new. And dare I say, they succeeded brilliantly.SOFTWARE:It's Windows Phone 7.5 Mango. You either love it, or hate it.Let me say that coming from Android/iOS, the first main differences I saw were the big and bold tiles, and the minimal homescreen. No gazillions of icons and folders cluttering up the screen. Everything is right there, in your face. Phone, SMS, Mail, Browser are all there and easily accessible the moment you turn on the screen. Very cool, I thought. But then, as an avid app user, I loaded up the Windows Marketplace. And boy, was I in for a huge disappointment. I'd known that this was a new ecosystem and there wouldn't be that many apps yet. But I didn't think that many of the iOS/Android apps (not games, don't care about those) that I often used wouldn't have an alternative for WP (more on this later).I was ready to return the phone. But then (yes, another turning point), I started using it. And I fell in love. The way Live Tiles work, instant updated info without loading the apps. The way ""People"" combines all/most of your social networks into one place. The way I stopped using my phone to do useless things and actually get stuff done. And of course, the way the Lumia 800 felt in my hands. Also, slowly, I started discovering new ways to find the apps that I want/need. Sure, I had to compromise and discarded certain apps that I don't really need, but I did manage to gather a good number of apps in the end.Windows Phone 7.5 isn't perfect. I still hate the way copy/paste is implemented. I still think the keyboard is awkward at times and too sensitive at others. I hate that there's no jailbreak/root, or as WP users call it ""Interop unlock"". Or how background tasking has a 9-processes limit. Or how there's no way to change text size in SMS. Or that the default Marketplace is rather unwelcoming and harder to navigate. And many more. But these minor bugs and inconveniences all become irrelevant when you look at the big picture. Windows Phone 7.5 is a brilliant mobile OS. You might call it the smartphone OS for newbies. I'm guessing the reason why it hasn't attracted that many people yet is the lack of quality phones. We haven't seen anything that is so stylish, so cool that can actually compete with the annual iPhone and monthly Androids. Until now.I'm definitely getting a Lumia 900 when it comes out in a few months (though I'll miss the curved glass). Good job Nokia and Microsoft. You've won me over.Update: I forgot to mention that the 800 has battery issues (doesn't last very long). I hear that there's a new update out that has fixed this problem, but I'm still waiting for them to push it out to my phone. Will confirm when I get it.",57.0,update i just realized i completely forgot to mention certain carrier info i m using the phone with at t in nyc doesn t work with their hspa yet i believe there will

Motorola Moto E (1st Generation) - Black - 4 GB - US GSM Unlocked Phone,Motorola,89.99,2,"UPDATE: 4/10/2015I finally went to use headphones with my phone just now and noticed that they don't snap into place (the cord can literally fall right out of the phone). Also, when plugged in, the headphones don't seem to make a connection with the phone (sound is not routed to the headphones), so I pushed just a little bit harder than normal to see if they would snap into place and the phone quickly showed sporadic signs that the headphones were plugged in and unplugged, and plugged in and unplugged, and so on and so forth (all of this with me barely touching the phone). Meanwhile, the headphones - which function perfectly normal - only had sound in the left earpiece. In short, I believe the problem with this phone to be the following:Due to a faulty headphone jack, the phone might be trying to route sound to headphones when none are even plugged in. This would explain why tapping the phone temporarily alleviates the issue as it jostles this faulty connection.*ORIGINAL: REVIEW*This is a really awesome phone (so why only two stars?), but unfortunately I experienced a pretty big issue.After about half a month of using this phone, my external speaker stopped working. I couldn't use:-Ringtones-Notifications (text, email, etc.)-Music-Alarms-Speaker phone calls-Basically anything that uses the external speakerAfter trying pretty much everything I could think of, such as restarting the phone, messing with all the different volume settings, I gently tapped on the backside of the phone about 8-10 times. To my amazement, audio to the speaker was restored, leaving me to believe there is possibly a loose connection to the external speaker.However, a friend convinced me to file a replacement claim (""you haven't had it long enough to be experiencing these kinds of issues.""), so I did. When the replacement arrived, I fully charged the battery, I transferred all my contacts, I updated all my aps, and all the other fun stuff you do when you get a new phone. All was well, except instead of lasting me half a month the external speaker decided to die after just 3 days. I reproduced the tapping on the backside of the phone and, sure enough, after a few attempts, sound was restored.This is apparently a common issue with the Moto E. Just google ""Moto E no sound"" to see for yourself. It's a shame, too, because this is such a great phone (read some of the 4-5 star reviews), but an issue like this can't be ignored. What good is a phone if it can't ring when someone is calling you?My review of two stars might seem harsh, but I did try two different phones and they both had the same issue. Amazon classifies two stars as ""I don't like it,"" which is pretty much what it took for me to decide to return it.Luckily amazon has a great return policy.",8.0,update i finally went to use headphones with my phone just now and noticed that they don t snap into place the cord can literally fall right out of the phone also when plugged in the headphones don t seem to make a connection with the phone sound is not routed to the headphones so i pushed just a little bit harder than normal to see if they would snap into place and the phone quickly showed sporadic signs that the headphones were plugged in and unplugged and plugged in and unplugged and so on and so forth all of this with me barely touching the phone meanwhile the headphones which function perfectly normal only had sound in the left earpiece in short i believe the problem with this phone to be the following due to a faulty headphone jack the phone might be trying to route sound to headphones when none are even plugged in this would explain why tapping the phone temporarily alleviates the issue as it jostles this faulty connection original review this is a really awesome phone so why only two stars but unfortunately i experienced a pretty big issue after about half a month of using this phone my external speaker stopped working i couldn t use ringtones notifications text email etc music alarms speaker phone calls basically anything that uses the external speakerafter trying pretty much everything i could think of such as restarting the phone messing with all the different volume settings i gently tapped on the backside of the phone about times to my amazement audio to the speaker was restored leaving me to believe there is possibly a loose connection to the external speaker however a friend convinced me to file a replacement claim you haven t had it long enough to be experiencing these kinds of issues so i did when the replacement arrived i fully charged the battery i transferred all my contacts i updated all my aps and all the other fun stuff you do when you get a new phone all was well except instead of lasting me half a month the external speaker decided to die after just days i reproduced the tapping on the backside of the phone and sure enough after a few attempts sound was restored this is apparently a common issue with the moto e just google moto e no sound to see for yourself it s a shame too because this is such a great phone read some of the star reviews but an issue like this can t be ignored what good is a phone if it can t ring when someone is calling you my review of two stars might seem harsh but i did try two different phones and they both had the same issue amazon classifies two stars as i don t like it which is pretty much what it took for me to decide to return it luckily amazon has a great return policy,update finally go use headphone phone notice don t snap place cord literally fall right phone plug headphone don t connection phone sound rout headphone push little bit hard normal snap place phone quickly show sporadic sign headphone plug unplugged plug unplugged forth barely touch phone headphone function perfectly normal sound left earpiece short believe problem phone following faulty headphone jack phone try route sound headphone plug explain tap phone temporarily alleviate issue jostle faulty connection original review awesome phone star unfortunately experience pretty big issue half month phone external speaker stop work couldn t use ringtone notification text email etc music alarm speaker phone call basically use external speakerafter try pretty think restart phone messing different volume setting gently tap backside phone time amazement audio speaker restore leave believe possibly loose connection external speaker friend convince file replacement claim haven t long experience kind issue replacement arrive fully charge battery transfer contact update aps fun stuff new phone instead last half month external speaker decide die day reproduce tapping backside phone sure attempt sound restore apparently common issue moto e google moto e sound s shame great phone read star review issue like t ignore good phone t ring call review star harsh try different phone issue amazon classify star don t like pretty take decide return luckily amazon great return policy,4,0.416,Overall Experience

"BLU Studio 5.0 HD Unlocked Cellphone, White",BLU,119.99,2,"I received this phone and decided to give the hardware a test drive before getting a sim card for it. Both cameras take fairly decent photos, but, for some reason the 5mp camera seemed to take higher resolution photos than the 13mp camera. The 13mp camera photos seemed a little dark and it had a difficult time focusing on an object. I installed a few games and all of them ran without stuttering. I was able to watch Youtube videos in 1080p without a hiccup over wifi, and I was able to transfer files over bluetooth, without a problem. The screen quality was OK, for the price of the phone. The included silicon case feels nice in the hand and the phone is just the right size for a man with large hands like myself.Where the phone started to fall short is the audio. I could barely hear any sound through the speakers and when I went to hook up an external speaker, nothing happened, no audio came out of the jack. I then tried a second speaker, same problem, I could not get an external speaker to work with the phone. Maybe a bluetooth speaker would work, but, I don't have one laying around to test it. I could hear some tinny noise through the included headphones, but, it is horrible and grated on my nerves.The final straw for the phone, was when I charged it and I went to unplug the wall wart from the wall. It was so hot I dropped it and my fingers were red. I then felt the back of the phone and it was also hot to the touch, even through the silicon case.

BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- US GSM Unlocked - Grey,BLU,139.0,4,"I have it for a month. This phone looks and feels fine for the price, however there are the following issues ( concerns)1. Camera 8 megapixels pictures look like 0.5 megapixels (number is for comparison only) . Quality is poor , but ok for basic pictures. For me it is not a big deal, since I prefer to use more advanced cameras for shooting.2. GPS is unreliable , Android 5.0 users complain a lot, this could be related. Provider is T-Mobile, but I tried turning off mobile network and using only GPS, same thing. It looses connection to satellites and says ""searching for GPS"" indefinitely. Navigation can't be used at all. HUGE concern.3. Contacts and phone application do not do the job. I have 400 contacts, sometimes they load, sometimes they do not. I could not find out what it depends on. Reboots, wiping cache partition and other tricks I found do not help. It might take up to 5 minutes till contacts appear. Searching is also i very slow. I tried Exdialer from google play, comes with contacts application as well, works a little better. However I see the same issue, contacts are not loading for a long time. reboots do not help. HUGE concern4. T-Mobile Visual voicemail did not work when SIM card was in an outside slot, moved it to the inside slot it works just fine.5. BLU Help application on the phone is not functioning6. Bloatware is present, but not nearly as much as on T-mobile phones. I was able to disable most of it. Some examples : Amazon apps, various google apps , Music Visualization Wallpapers. Opera browser., Photo screensavers, etc.7. Microphone is in the right bottom corner. I am right handed. While holding this phone by the right ear, and holding it with the left hand, in case I need to operate a mouse on a computer, I close the mic. Need to learn to say ""hold on"" to someone on the line and move the phone to the left ear. Not a big deal, but I keep forgetting and people complain they can't hear me.I messaged BLU support, listing these concerns, will update this review once I get a response.If the above issues with GPS and Contacts are addressed I would be very happy with my phone. I need it for basic things, I do not play games and I am OK with poor quality camera. So far, I have a feeling that it might be Android 5.0 related, since I see that people with 5.1 claim that had such issues addressed. Phone is performing well otherwise. I did not see any issues with WiFi or bluetooth.----------------------------------------------------------Update-----------------------------------------------------------I received a response to my inquiry from BLU, it had the following instructions to reset my phone. That should have solved my issues with contacts. After the phone was reset, it worked indeed. The problem is I had to reinstall all apps, and load my information to the phone again.The phone is working fine, I increased rating from 3 to 4. The things I still do not like and wish they were better.1. Bad quality camera - I am fine with this2. Unreliable GPS - I am not fine with this, but can live with another option I have.----------------------------------------------------------Letter from BLU----------------------------------------------------------Hello,Thank you for contacting BLU Products.

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone International Version (Black) - NO WARRANTY,Samsung,514.99,4,"Alright, I got my s7 around late march, (yes, just in time to miss every special offer with the gear vr) and I have to say, I absolutely love this phone. It is, as expected, the FASTEST phone I have ever had, considering it has better processing speeds than normal computers did a few years ago, and it looks GREAT. Yes, they did come with android upgrades in general, but Samsung has made MASSIVE improvements to their UI, ease of access connection speeds, and an amazing screen just overall. However, there are some issues that I have with it, things I wish were included, and just overall some comments about the phone and features1) BATTERY LIFE. Now, I understand that people have been commending it for its battery life, but I personally find it running out all too often. It seems that every flagship phone of this generation has been jumping on the Quad-HD bandwagon, and the s7 is no different. Yes, it looks slightly better, but, according to logic and IN MY EXPERIENCE, it drains battery life WAY faster than the max 1080p screen of old. One of the main differences between this device, and the LG G3 ,the flagship that basically pioneered the Quad-HD phone space, is that the s7 does not have a removable battery. On top of that, there is the adaptive display, which unlike 2k, (Quad-HD) makes a huge difference, making the screen extremely vibrant and attractive. HOWEVER, this drains a ton of battery too in my experience; thankfully you can turn it off. Also, is it just me, or does the battery DRAIN faster when charged with fast charge, too.2) PHYSICAL GLASS. Alright, I'm going to be perfectly honest, most of this is more of a pro than a con, but I would just like to comment on the corning gorilla glass 4 that this phone has both on front and back. The glass on the front I'd say is pretty great. I have for some reason treated this phone worse than I have with any other, but it's held up amazingly. There are minimal scratches and even after a freak Pokemon Go accident that would've completely shattered the screen of any phone I've ever had, it was left with a small CHIP in the right-hand corner. Yes, a CHIP. Now, I know by the way I said it, it sounds like a bad thing, but I thought it was amazing. I mean, I threw that thing HARD, and I think, the fact that it chipped rather than shatter into a million pieces was a REALLY good thing(picture of crack attached[if you can even see it]). Now for the back. I hate that it has a glass back. Yes, it looks nice, and yes, I always have a case protecting it anyway, but for those who don't believe in cases, and like many users, hate the active series, I don't care what kind of glass you put on the back, it will not be as durable as a GOOD metal back.3) Lack Of An IR Blaster. Now I know this was an unusual feature to be integrated into a smartphone in the first place, but I really do miss the IR blaster. It was so very convenient to be able to replace every remote in your house without separate, $100-300 hardware. Yes, it was a little finicky, but I think that calls for improvement, not SCRAPPING IT ENTIRELY. I get it though, it was a thing that no average user really used, or even KNEW about, and that made it not worth even including because it raised the production value, but I LIKED IT. It was VERY NICE.4) WATERPROOFING. This one is most definitely a pro. I quite like the waterproofing of the s7. As I said, I have treated this phone worse than any I have ever had, and that includes taking it places where I thought it might get really wet, like I mean soaking. Well, it has held up amazingly so far, accidental drops in sinks and similar things proved to be absolutely nothing to this phone, and I have tested it in the very hot shower with great results.5) SAMSUNG PAY. Alright, I'll say it, I love Samsung Pay. It is so convenient, and hilarious blowing cashiers' minds wherever you go. Although, there are some issues with this too, however pretty minor and some easily fixable. The few issues that I have with samsung pay are:A) the lack of support for banks and credit cards that are not partnered with Samsung. I understand that this could be for a few reasons, either some banks are too small, neither are nor wish to be associated with Samsung, and for security reasons, but that doesn't change that you just can't use some cards on samsung play that you would very much like to use, and that I believe that Samsung could fix this by pushing harder to partner with every bank they can, even if it means setting up the systems for them.B) The difficulty involved with the use of Samsung Pay. This includes the fact that getting the card to read is pretty difficult, and even if you know how to do it perfectly, sometimes it takes a couple tries, and the ignorance of just about every snarky cashier on Earth, not letting you even attempt to pay with Samsung Pay, because ""they don't have the system set up.""Overall, as I said, this is an amazing phone, great choice for a flagship, but there are some issues, missed opportunities, and good things that stood out about the galaxy s7 that I thought were worth mentioning in this review. And I realize this was probably a very negative sounding review in contrast to my ratings, but I really do love this phone, I just think the good things don't really need explainingNOTE: This is my own written review, HOWEVER, I previously posted it on the Samsung website as an entry to a sweepstakes. Also, I did not purchase the phone from amazon, nor did I purchase mine unlocked, so I cannot speak to the compatibility of this unlocked item with different sim cards, but I felt the need to post it here, as it is the exact same product, and this is the listing directly from Samsung.PICTURE: The chip on my screen mentioned above",9.0,alright i got my s around late march yes just in time to miss

user really used or even knew about and that made it not worth even including because it raised the production value but i liked it it was very nice waterproofing this one is most definitely a pro i quite like the waterproofing of the s as i said i have treated this phone worse than any i have ever had and that includes taking it places where i thought it might get really wet like i mean soaking well it has held up amazingly so far accidental drops in sinks and similar things proved to be absolutely nothing to this phone and i have tested it in the very hot shower with great results samsung pay alright i ll say it i love samsung pay it is so convenient and hilarious blowing cashiers minds wherever you go although there are some issues with this too however pretty minor and some easily fixable the few issues that i have with samsung pay are a the lack of support for banks and credit cards that are not partnered with samsung i understand that this could be for a few reasons either some banks are too small neither are nor wish to be associated with samsung and for security reasons but that doesn t change that you just can t use some cards on samsung play that you would very much like to use and that i believe that samsung could fix this by pushing harder to partner with every bank they can even if it means setting up the systems for them b the difficulty involved with the use of samsung pay this includes the fact that getting the card to read is pretty difficult and even if you know how to do it perfectly sometimes it takes a couple tries and the ignorance of just about every snarky cashier on earth not letting you even attempt to pay with samsung pay because they don t have the system set up overall as i said this is an amazing phone great choice for a flagship but there are some issues missed opportunities and good things that stood out about the galaxy s that i thought were worth mentioning in this review and i realize this was probably a very negative sounding review in contrast to my ratings but i really do love this phone i just think the good things don t really need explainingnote this is my own written review however i previously posted it on the samsung website as an entry to a sweepstakes also i did not purchase the phone from amazon nor did i purchase mine unlocked so i cannot speak to the compatibility of this unlocked item with different sim cards but i felt the need to post it here as it is the exact same product and this is the listing directly from samsung picture the chip on my screen mentioned above,alright get s late

As a former android user and a college student, Window phone is great. android is great too, but the apps can be overwhelming sometimes...this is really helping me manage my time well. 950xl is great in most areas you need it for. Most of the apps you might need are available. If you're entrenched in google's ecosystem like I am it can be a little hard, but you'll get used to it. I like W10, its fluid. No lagging whatsoever, the battery is great a single charge throughout the day, the back camera is good, but the selfie cam is not the best, and the display is beautiful. The phone is customizable to a good degree, I haven't figured it all out. It has the S7 glance screen, it has LG's knock knock feature, the iris scanner is on point, even in dark spaces it recognise my iris, Cortana reads your text if you have Bluetooth headphone on, this comes in handy when I'm biking ...apps like camscanner and mystudylife and lots of other useful app is in the store. The US states and other country's map can be downloaded for offline navigation, but only driving and walking navigation, New York's MTA map is not there, ( I'm a lil sour about that since I mostly take the train). there are many more features, In my opinion, if you really want to spend less time on unnecessary apps, but take note, set reminders/calendars text and call, play a few games and listen to music. this is a great phone.P.S: I've had it for a month now.I have a small android tablet for my bank apps and some other apps for conveniency...and khan academy",0.0,this is one of my very few reviews on amazon as a former android user and a college student window phone is great android is great too but the apps can be overwhelming sometimes this is really helping me manage my time well xl is great in most areas you need it for most of the apps you might need are available if you re entrenched in google s ecosystem like i am it can be a little hard but you ll get used to it i like w its fluid no lagging whatsoever the battery is great a single charge throughout the day the back camera is good but the selfie cam is not the best and the display is beautiful the phone is customizable to a good degree i haven t figured it all out it has the s glance screen it has lg s knock knock feature the iris scanner is on point even in dark spaces it recognise my iris cortana reads your text if you have bluetooth headphone on this comes in handy when i m biking apps like camscanner and mystudylife and lots of other useful app is in the store the us states and other country s map can be downloaded for offline navigation but only driving and walking navigation new york s mta map is not there i m a lil sour about that since i mostly take the train there are many more features in my opinion if you really want to spend less time on unnecessary apps but take note set reminders calendars text and call play a few games and listen to music this is a great phone p s i ve had it for a month now i have a small android tablet for my bank apps and some other apps for conveniency and khan academy,review amazon android user college student window phone great android great app overwhelming help manage time xl great area need app need available entrench google s ecosystem like little hard ll like w fluid lagging whatsoever battery great single charge day camera good selfie cam good display beautiful phone customizable good degree haven t figure s glance screen lg s knock knock feature iris scanner point dark space recognise iris cortana read text bluetooth headphone come handy m bike app like camscanner mystudylife lot useful app store state country s map download offline navigation drive walk navigation new york s mta map m lil sour train feature opinion want spend time unnecessary app note set reminder calendar text play game listen music great phone p s ve month small android tablet bank app app conveniency khan academy,4,0.666,Overall Experience

Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone,Nokia,59.95,1,"So despite some of the negative reviews I still decided to buy the phone and I was disappointed with this purchase. This is my first Nokia. I have been a loyal SE customer for many years and since my C905a broke, I thought why not give another brand a try? Overall, I think I prefer SE models more. Maybe it's because I've gotten so used to them but I think their UI is just more user friendly. However, I have gotten use to this phone and I do like it. I love the fact that it has a lot of smartphone features. The wireless internet is awesome. I don't have to worry about the stupid data plan AT&T makes you sign up for. I like all the many shortcut buttons. So even without the widget bar, I still have access to most of my applications. However, I think it's the luck of the draw. Some reviewers had no problem with this phone but within the first couple of days of using it, it would just freeze up and shut down on me. So frustrating! And video playback sucks. Everytime I would play a video the screen would freeze after just a few seconds. Plus no volume rocker. I knew the phone didn't have one but I didn't realize how much I would miss it! I like to listen to music while I'm doing other stuff on the phone. There's no way to skip to the next song or change the station or adjust the volume other than quitting the application you're doing and going back to your media player. (I guess I'm spoiled from my other SE phones.) I do have my phone settings like ringtones and such set to files on my SD card. And everytime I would take the card out and put it back in, my settings would be reset to the original. What the heck?! So I'm sending it back and because I do like the brand, I'm going to give Nokia one more chance and upgrade it to a C6 and try their touch screen phones now. I'm crossing my fingers that the upgraded model will have gotten most of the bugs out and I won't have the same problems. If not, I think I'll have to go back to my SE roots and give W995a a try instead. So if you're thinking of buying this phone, I would recommending upgrading and getting an E5 instead.",3.0,so despite some of the negative reviews i still decided to buy the phone and i was disappointed with this purchase this is my first nokia i have been a loyal se customer for many years and since my c a broke i thought why not give another brand a try overall i think i prefer se models more maybe it s because i ve gotten so used to them but i think their ui is just more user friendly however i have gotten use to this phone and i do like it i love the fact that it has a lot of smartphone features the wireless internet is awesome i don t have to worry about the stupid data plan at t makes you sign up for i like all the many shortcut buttons so even without the widget bar i still have access to most of my applications however i think it s the luck of the draw some reviewers had no problem with this phone but within the first couple of days of using it it would just freeze up and shut down on me so frustrating and video playback sucks everytime i would play a video the screen would freeze after just a few seconds plus no volume rocker i knew the phone didn t have one but i didn t realize how much i would miss it i like to listen to music while i m doing other stuff on the phone there s no way to skip to the next song or change the station or adjust the volume other than quitting the application you re doing and going back to your media player i guess i m spoiled from my other se phones i do have my phone settings like ringtones and such set to files on my sd card and everytime i would take the card out and put it back in my settings would be reset to the original what the heck so i m sending it back and because i do like the brand i m going to give nokia one more chance and upgrade it to a c and try their touch screen phones now i m crossing my fingers that the upgraded model will have gotten most of the bugs out and i won t have the same problems if not i think i ll have to go back to my se roots and give w a a try instead so if you re thinking of buying this phone i would recommending upgrading and getting an e instead,despite negative review decide buy phone disappoint purchase nokia loyal se customer year c broke think brand try overall think prefer se model maybe s ve get think ui user friendly get use phone like love fact lot smartphone feature wireless internet awesome don t worry stupid datum plan t make sign like shortcut button widget bar access application think s luck draw reviewer problem phone couple day freeze shut frustrating video playback suck everytime play video screen freeze second plus volume rocker know phone didn t didn t realize miss like listen music m stuff phone s way skip song change station adjust volume quit application go medium player guess m spoil se phone phone setting like ringtone set file sd card everytime card setting reset original heck m send like brand m go nokia chance upgrade c try touch screen phone m cross finger upgrade model get bug win t problem think ll se root w try instead think buy phone recommend upgrading get e instead,4,0.444,Overall Experience
Nokia C2-01.5 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Music and Video Player--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black),Nokia,98.0,5,"Was looking to replace a 7 year old Nokia that finally gave up. I was surprised to find out that Nokia still made the candybar style non-touch screen phones. I don't have a data plan with my ATT service, so I can't comment on the internet features. Added a 16GB microSD card and loaded it up with music. The overall interface is simple and intuitive. The built in media player recognized a direct copy/paste of my iTunes library without issue. No issues syncing up with Windows 7 Pro 64 Bit. The Nokia Ovi PC software worked fine and allowed me to finally back up my extensive collection of contacts. For a basic little phone it is feature loaded without compromising the primary function of being a phone. If you want a good PHONE, this is the ticket. I do recommend the purchase of the plastic skin that covers the back of the phone.

HTC One M7 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Android Cell Phone - Silver,HTC,133.95,5,"I originally purchased the HTC One M7 when it came out in 2013. I loved the phone - solid, beautifully built and with an excellent UI, especially Blink Feed. Due to my job, I traveled all over the country and this phone kept me company and traveled exceptionally well. I disabled every app that I didn't need and with the power saver, never had to worry about not having enough juice for 2-3 days. I appreciated how HTC pushed updates out regularly - service packs for their software and Android. Final android version is 5.0.2. Phone survived numerous drops, only resulting in a few nicks on the aluminum body, with the screen never getting cracked. One night out, a friend spilled some beer on it and after it dried I started getting a lot of static through the phone jack. A call to HTC customer support got it back to fine working condition is short order. Fast, friendly and effective customer service.Recently my original M7 suddenly stopped making phone calls. I could call my voicemail, and receive text messages, but not make phone calls. After 3 hours at the AT&T store trouble shooting the phone, they recommended purchasing a new phone. Even with this model being ~3 years old, it was a no brainer to purchase another one for $165 new. The black color is sharp and clean.Another item I like about HTC is they support unlocking the boot loader to root and install custom ROMs. This is exactly what I did with my old HTC one.

I had previously purchased a BLU phone and loved it but after 2 yrs it was time to replace it. I saw this one and ordered it. It came quickly and was packaged nicely. It came with a slim case which is just a snap on cover, a charger and headphones. I watched a you tube video before I received the phone and was really looking forward to its arrival. It came on my Birthday so it was a nice gift. I ordered the gold one which I absolutely loved. The reviews and description boost about its long battery life and quick charging. I un-packaged it at 75%. Started to set it up, adding my gmail account, setting alarms. Just the basics. Took me about 30 min. At that time the battery level had dropped to 22%. Since it was right out of the box I decided to charge it. I used the charger that came with it. It was late so I set it on the dresser and went to bed. In the morning I checked it and it was at 66%. I didn't understand. It was supposed to charge completely in 10 min. After that I had to have it on the charger constantly. The screen started to freeze before the end of the same day. Then the screen wasn't reacting to my finger swipes. I tried to use GPS but if I opened another app or got a text or call it would close the maps app. I found myself restarting the phone about a dozen times in just the first day.

I have been working my way through the User Guide, slowly coming up to speed on its seemingly endless capabilities. I won't even call it a cell phone any more - that is only a minor function of what is in reality a portable computer with a communication feature. My highlights so far:The phone itself works exceptionally well. I plugged in the SIM chip from my old cell (AT&T) and was up and running immediately. I am looking forward to using this unit in Europe next year. Since it is unlocked, you can buy inexpensive Vodaphone SIMs from just about any newsstand and all your in-country calls become local calls at pennies per minute. No more exorbitant roaming fees. And the quad-band capability ensures you will connect virtually anywhere.I had no problem using the WLAN feature. It hooked up with my home wireless network flawlessly, and so far, has found and connected with various other Wifi hot spots around town. The internet browser is excellent and once I figured out how to get my e-mail retrieval set up, I was able to check my home mailbox with ease. Very convenient feature!The camera takes excellent photos considering it is a cell camera. With 5 megapixels and the Carl Zeiss lens, you end up with pictures good enough to post on a web site (I did). I also like the performance of the video capture and plan to use it more often.Bluetooth paired up seamlessly in my car and with my ear bud. I tested the unit's FM radio using my Bose head set and the N95 picked up all the stations in range quickly. The quality of the sound was exceptional! I also played some downloaded sounds and some streaming video. Excellent performance.After dowloading the Nokia software on my home PC, I tested the N95's Office features by downloading some PDF, Excel, and Word files to the phone. They are all accessible on the N95 and very easy to view on the high resolution LCD. I plan to purchase the software that will allow me to edit these files on the N95. I already bought a portable bluetooth keyboard that I will use with the unit as well. With that, I will have many of the functions previously available only on my laptop.The GPS is excellent. I had no problem acquiring satellites, even indoors on a couple of occasions. My phone came with a complementary six-month subscription to all the voice guidance features. I have used this in my car to test routing and it matches up well with the GPS built in to my 2008 Dodge Magnum.In summary, I am extremely pleased with the N95 8GB unit.

Blackberry Q5 Black Unlocked,,124.99,1,"This is by far the worst blackberry I've ever owned. They got rid of so many of the features that made blackberry a good product and tried to make it more like an iphone. The new operating system is the worst. There are counter intuitive features and they did away with the ability to have your email as icons. Now everything is in this ""hub"" that is accessed differently than every icon. It does weird things like if I am typing a text message, the option to actually send it disappears and I have to reset the phone for it to come back.The loss of the central mouse button and answer/hangup buttons is a huge loss too.Lastly, the new operating systems accepts even fewer apps than the previous versions if you can imagine that!

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,4,"I have been a Tmobile prepaid customer for about six years now. I use fifty to a hundred dollars worth of time a year. Service was good until I put a tin roof on my house and it blocked the signal. I knew Tmobile let you access their network through a home wireless so I went looking for a new GSM phone with WiFi capabilities. The ones I liked were way expensive without a contract but I got serious when my old RAZR started giving me trouble around Christmas.I found this one on Amazon and started looking at the specs and reading the reviews. I needed a phone with WiFi for the house. I wanted one that would play my music. I wanted one that I could use my existing prepaid simm without buying a data plan. Not as simple as it sounds but this phone performs the functions quite well. In addition I installed SKYPE and it works perfectly in the house. I use a SKYPE out subscription for my long distance calls (I am on prepaid remember and even though the phone connects through my WiFi it uses minutes) and all the long distance calls for a year are $30.The battery could last longer but it is acceptable if I charge it every night. As others have stated the bloatware is horrific and I will fix this as soon as I root the phone in the next few days. This should also help with the battery life.The sad thing is I went to my local world wide everything for everybody department store looking for accessories. A silicone skin, some screen protectors and so on. Not a thing and they sell this phone. They did have two isles of iphone accessories but then they don't sell iphones at that particular store.I am just getting started. I will check back if any thing really good or surprising happens. OH and anything bad.ONE MONTH AFTER PURCHASEI rooted the phone and cleaned up the bloatware. Put in a 16Mb Micro SD and lots of music. I am on a road trip and use the SKYPE for calls anywhere I stop with WiFi. Loaded some useful free apps and a few paid ones.

HTC Vivid X710a 16GB Unlocked GSM Android Dual-Core Smartphone - White (No Warranty),HTC,97.99,4,"I have had this phone for nearly two years and probably should have left a review immediately after purchasing but I have really enjoyed it until recently!PROS:- VERY durable! I have dropped it numerous times without a case and it always makes it through without a problem. Except for a few dings and kinks along the edges it has survived many a fall.- Easy to hold. This one may seem ridiculous but it really does have a good weight to it and I like the way it feels in my hand.- Good size. A little long but certainly nothing like a Samsung and comparable to the size of an iPhone but unlike the iPhone, the screen on this takes up most of the face of the phone, which is great!- Super user friendly, easy to use. The icons make everything very clear and if that's not enough, there are usually written descriptions as well.- Love love love the visual voice mail- The clock settings are pretty great. I know a lot of friends who have had to download stopwatch apps, timer apps, etc. to their iPhones but this one has alarm, stopwatch, timer, world clock, and desk clock features right in it.- The camera is hit or miss for me now but for the first ten months of owning the phone, they were exceptional. Super crisp, clear, and high quality.- The maps app and GPS features are really fantastic. Until the iPhone 5 came out with their new maps features, my friends were always jealous of how easy mine is to use and how effective it is, consistently.- Has almost every regular smartphone feature and operates really well.CONS:- I hate not being able to group text like on an iPhone. You can send a group text to multiple people but their responses will come in individually and you can only respond to one person at a time. Moreover, when you send a group text, no one else can see that it's a group text and might be confused why you are talking in plurals, or wonder who else received it, etc.- Can't ""drop a pin"" or receive a dropped pin like on an iPhone. This has only become frustrating recently as that's all my friends with iPhones want to do instead of giving me an address or verbally giving me directions.- No imessage or bbm kind of feature. If you want to text someone using data or WiFi, you'll have to download an app like WhatsApp or Viber. Not a big deal but I was a little jealous when I was in another country and I had to pull up an app to text family back in the States while my friend simply imessaged hers.- The phone is pretty sensitive to temperature. For most of the time I owned this phone I was living in Austin, TX and when I held it to my ear while walking anywhere outside, the combination of my sweat and the heat would make it either malfunction or turn off. Same thing with the cold. When I was in Montreal in the wintertime unless my phone was in my pocket it would literally turn off because it was so cold.- It is a little frustrating when I want to send pictures as an attachment to an email. You can only choose one picture at a time from your gallery, return to the email, click attach, choose another one from the gallery, etc. Moreover, you can only attach 5-6 photos max to an email. It's time consuming and I always wish I could select all the photos I want in one quick swoop. Not a huge deal but enough to be annoying. But that said, I think you can only attach 5 photos at a time to an email on an iPhone anyway.- For 2014, some of the features on the phone- just the look of some of the icons, apps, design, etc.- seem a little outdated. But everything works and operates just as effectively as any other smartphone.Conclusion: This phone is great for the non-conformists who don't want to get an iPhone. I was that person for a while but I think I am finally ready to take the plunge.",0.0,i have had this phone for nearly two years and probably should have left a review immediately after purchasing but

Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony,489.99,4,"The Sony Xperia Z5 premium phone is one that will certainly get people's attention.It is stylish, it is a beast of a phone, and above all, it is everything you would expect from a premium Sony phone.I love a lot of things on my Z5 premium. Some are great upgrades from my previous phone, the Z1.This is just personal preferences, but I liked the Walkman App before it turned to the Android Lollipop Music App.Lollipop is just not type. I will probably revert to KitKat because I love the UI and overall feel better than Lollipop's.The power button is slightly sunken. Unlike the Z1, where it was easily accessible with a slightly outward button.Lastly, and yes, this is was shocking for me as well. The screen.With a whopping 806 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) 4K screen, you would expect the display quality to be as clear as looking out a window. So unless I bought a faulty phone, I kid you not, the screen looks pixelated. Yes, you read that right. Pixelated.Now, I know that everything except the Album and Video apps are down-scaled to 1080P. So I tested the 4K photos and videos, and to my astonishment, there they are! Still looking pixelated, even at 4K. I had to look through a magnifying glass to see them up close. I compared my old Z1, my dad's Z Ultra and the Z5 Premium. Again big surprise, both my old Z1 and the Z ultra pixels can barely be seen, with very faint black lines separating the pixels, while on the Z5 Premium the lines were considerably much more noticeable.Looking at all three phones from a normal distance, the Z1 and Z Ultra's screens do not look pixelated at all, while my Z5, even from a fair distance, you can still faintly see the pixelation.Basically, I have phone with a 4K display, but it almost makes me feel like it has a WVGA display.Lastly, I've never seen a phone reflect dots from a turned off display before.

The display is very sharp.For a featured (non -smart) phone, you can not beat the price for this quality. So my rating is having the price in mind.It consumes very little power on standby. It can last as long as six days without charging.This phone is not very fast, but better than other AT&T phones I had. The camera is so so but I don't use that function much anyway.It has a microSD slot which can go very large in storage. It is better for music than photos. I tried the image function. It certainly stores the photos you take from the phone. But if you load other large size photos into the SD card, the phone does not have enough power to display a large size photograph. So it you want to use this device to carry photos you took elsewhere, you have down size them first before loading into the SDcard. But consider other feature phones which do not even display any photos, this is a good function.In addition to the QWERTY keyboard, the has the T9 input function, a smart fast typing capability, good for composing long text content.My only gripe is that it has built in English and Spanish input options, but no other language (e.g. Chinese) input options. It displays Chinese (incoming text) well.

The phone is nice looking and stylish, and I love the pearl white color, but I'm a bit confused that the back of my phone only says Samsung, but does not display 'S6' like the other Samsung S6's that are sold here in America. The writing on the back is in another language, not English, so maybe it's made different in other countries? I have noticed the battery drains faster than my last Samsung S3 mini that I had for 3 years, and I have had the phone freeze up on me a couple of times and the screen turned black and locked up. I called Samsung customer service and they told me how to reset by pressing the down volume button and the button on the right side of the phone both at the same time for 20-30 seconds. I'm hoping that doesn't happen very often and has me a bit nervous. I'm past the time frame where I can return the phone now, so I hope I won't have any major issues since I paid $450.00, and would like to have it for at least 2-3 more years.

Nokia 2720 S40 Unlocked Flip Phone with 1.3 MP Camera with Bluetooth--US Version with Full Warranty,Nokia,264.1,2,"I bought this phone as a temporary phone to use until my contract was up and I could get a free phone. First off the phone took 2 weeks to arrive and when it finally arrived I found out it was a refurbished phone (which was never mentioned)The box the phone came in was ripped up and contents were cheaply wrapped in plastic that is how I knew it was refurbished. The phone itself sucks, it is very difficult to hear anyone or for anyone to hear me while speaking on it. The cover on the back that goes over the battery is a thin flimsy piece of plastic which constantly falls off while in my pocketbook and the battery falls out. The camera on it is horrible, I had less expensive phones that had much better picture quality then this phone. Another thing is when you want to get back to main screen simply closing phone won't do it. You have to push end several times to get back to main screen. When I close phone after phone call it is still connected unless I press exit or end. Same thing goes for texting it will leave you on text you wrote or recently read, simply closing phone won't bring you back to main menu. When using the speaker phone option you can't initiate speaker until the other party answers which is very annoying.

Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black),Huawei,229.99,4,"Update: I've been using this phone for 5 months now and have not had any issues with it. In fact about 3 months ago I bought another phone just like this one for my wife so she would leave mine alone. She has had no problems at all with her phone either so I may update my star rating later if neither of us have any issues over the next couple of months. First off I want to make it clear that I really like this phone and I have to give Amazon 5 stars on their return policies as this phone did push that. Like I said I really like the phone but I did have some problems starting out. With phone number 1 it arrived late on a Friday so I spent most of my Friday evening moving everything from my Galaxy S3 over to my new Huawei Mate 2. I tried putting my sim card in there and it would not recognize it so I figured I must need a newer more up to date sim card since mine was 3 years old. So using my home WI-FI and other apps I got everything moved over and operating on my new Huawei mate 2 phone. So Saturday afternoon I went to the local T-Mobile store to see about getting a new sim card. They informed me that my card should work in it but once again the phone wouldn’t recognize it. So one of the employees put their sim card into it and once again it didn’t see the sim card. After numerous attempts to get the phone to work I was told the bad news that I had a defective phone. So as reluctant that I was to have to move everything back to my old phone I didn’t have much choice. I contacted Amazon customer service and they overnighted me a replacement phone. The first thing I did was try my sim card in it and it came right up Yay!!! So I moved everything off the broken Huawei to the replacement phone. Everything was going great but then I noticed that I haven’t received any emails all day and the weather app temperature outside had not changed. So did a speed test and discovered I had no data connection but I did have cell phone service so I thought well maybe I need to reboot since I had made so many changes to the phone. So I did that and low and behold I had data again everything was great again. The next day I noticed once again that I had phone service but no data so I rebooted the phone and all was great again for about an hour. Then I noticed the temperature app wasn’t updating again. I decided to send myself an email from our house cell phone which is also on T-Mobile after nearly 30 minutes no email again. I checked my other cell phone and it showed it as sent and I checked the data speed and was running at a very good speed on my Galaxy S2 home phone. So I did a data speed check on my Huawei Mate 2. Nothing once again so I rebooted it and had my data back once again. Then about 2 hours later no mail and no temperature change. Checked the data speed and once again zero until I rebooted the phone again. At this point I knew I was dealing with a phone that going to have to be rebooted 6 or 8 times a day if you wanted to get any data from it. So I once again contacted Amazon Customer Service and they again overnighted me a replacement phone. At this point I have become an expert on transferring apps and data from one phone to another. I’m going out on a limb here in following the old saying 3rd time is a charm as I am now 2 days into my new Huawei Mate 2 phone and at the risk of jinxing it so far there have been no problems with this phone. I will update my review if this changes anytime soon. I still recommend the phone because when it works that huge screen makes it so easy to read news and watch movies and TV on. Once again I have to give Amazon Customer Service 5 stars and I would have given this phone 5 stars had I not encountered 2 bad phones in a row. But as stated I’m keeping this one and I hope it performs as well as it does today 3 or 4 years from now. My Galaxy S3 is almost 4 and it still works fine I was just looking for something with a bigger screen as my eyes aren’t nearly as good as they once were. But yes I would recommend a person to buy it, but by it from Amazon in case you have any trouble from the start as they have some of the best customer service I have ever seen.",3.0,update i ve been

Studio 7.0 LTE - Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - Grey,BLU,,3,"This phone worked for what I was looking for. I got a fourth line free from T-Mobile for a promotion and all lines have unlimited data. Turns out you cannot easily use a tablet on a phone sim or a phone on a tablet data only sim. This phone is big enough to be considered a tablet but since it is actually a phone, I can use my fourth line with it and take advantage of my unlimited data.As for the phone, the specs are low. The 1 GB RAM is not enough and combined with the other components the phone is slow and there is an amazing amount of lag. It also occasionally freezes or misbehaves in general. Multi-tasking is very limited and is not recommended. I would not use this phone as my primary device. As a second or a backup, it gets the job done. It meets my needs for a 'tablet' that can use a phone sim or as a mobile hot spot.If you keep everything in perspective and don't expect a $200 retail ($130 ish here) phone to even come close in screen resolution or hardware performance, the phone is nice. Just don't think it is going to keep up with a $500-$800 flagship phone.Since it filled my particular need, I would give it 5 stars (as being about the only 7"" phone option for USA T-Mobile) but the very low specs reduce it to 3 stars.",0.0,this phone worked for what i was looking for i got a fourth line free from t mobile for a promotion and all lines have unlimited data turns out you cannot easily use a tablet on a phone sim or a phone on a tablet data only sim this phone is big enough to be considered a tablet but since it is actually a phone i can use my fourth line with it and take advantage of my unlimited data as for the phone the specs are low the gb ram is not enough and combined with the other components the phone is slow and there is an amazing amount of lag it also occasionally freezes or misbehaves in general multi tasking is very limited and is not recommended i would not use this phone as my primary device as a second or a backup it gets the job done it meets my needs for a tablet that can use a phone sim or as a mobile hot spot if you keep everything in perspective and don t expect a retail ish here phone to even come close in screen resolution or hardware performance the phone is nice just don t think it is going to keep up with a flagship phone since it filled my particular need i would give it stars as being about the only phone option for usa t mobile but the very low specs reduce it to stars,phone work look get fourth line free t mobile promotion line unlimited datum turn easily use tablet phone sim phone tablet datum sim phone big consider tablet actually phone use fourth line advantage unlimited datum phone spec low gb ram combine component phone slow amazing lag occasionally freeze misbehave general multi tasking limited recommend use phone primary device second backup get job meet need tablet use phone sim mobile hot spot perspective don t expect retail ish phone come close screen resolution hardware performance phone nice don t think go flagship phone fill particular need star phone option usa t mobile low spec reduce star,4,0.616,Overall Experience

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 64GB - Sunrise Gold - GSM - US Warranty,,449.99,3,"After going through 3x LG G-series phones in as many years due to lousy build quality (bad touchscreen, screen detachment, bad motherboard/boot loop issues), I decided to abandon the brand. As a consumer, I prize build quality, durability, intuitive controls, and bang for your buck. To put things in perspective, my favorite all-time smartphone design is the Motorola Defy: it was built like a tank and worked underwater; it was rugged--you could drop it and it would barely scratch (no need for a phone case); had minimal bloat-wear; and served perfectly as an Every Day Carry (EDC) workhorse. Unfortunately, due to the current marketing strategy for cell phones, phones like the Defy are unicorns: the market currently is littered with disposable consumer goods built to be glass houses so manufacturers can increase profit. This led to a frustrating search high and low for a mid-tier phone that had good reviews with a decent camera; good build quality; impressive specs for the money; and a solid User Interface (UI) experience. That is, until I came across Huawei, and the Honor 8.Professional and amateur reviews I found were nearly universally positive, pointing to a beautiful body design; good customer support; good camera; good specs, and compatibility with T-Mobile’s 12 band (a lot of other Chinese-made, and international-version phones don’t support 12 band). I started leaning towards purchasing an Honor 8 (U.S. Warranty), but the one thing that held me back were the divisive “love it or leave it” attitudes towards Huawei’s EMUI. Then, I heard they would be replacing EMUI 4.1 in the near future, and Amazon featured a deep discount on Black Friday for the phone (selling it under $300), so I pulled the trigger and made the purchase. I’m about 2 weeks into using this phone, and while I want to love my Honor 8 as much as I did my Defy, Huawei's EMUI 4.1 greatly reduces my enjoyment and experience. This is why I deducted two stars, as EMUI is non-intuitive, and can be extremely frustrating when you miss notifications because of EMUI settings. If and when Huawei updates EMUI away from 4.1, I will give an updated review.Pros:+The phone is relatively slim, and great for one-handed operation.+The phone is fast. The screen unlocks as soon as you touch the fingerprint sensor, and I haven’t experienced lag on any apps.+Battery life is really good. I can go through my commute and work day without having to charge my phone.+The camera is decent quality (minor lag at times when it’s trying to focus), and has friendly controls. I’ve been spoiled by LG’s cameras, but I feel the Honor 8 performs well.+Beautiful external design, but slippery. Definitely get a case for this phone if you don’t want it sliding around.+Vibrant display, and transition times between dark/brightly lit rooms is good.+The phone will turn on WiFi to connect to a known network when you’re in an area you frequent.Cons:-EMUI 4.1! EMUI 4.1!! EMUI 4.1!!!-Initial setup when switching from an old phone to the Honor 8 takes an extremely long time compared to stock Android. This is because EMUI has a bunch of settings you need to micromanage, ranging from app permissions, to notifications, to battery use. What I miss about LG is whenever I upgraded a phone, I’d just connect the two phones via NFC and everything would sync up.-Settings continued: rather than having everything default to being enabled, you have to manually enable some settings. This means if you’re not careful, some of your social media apps and email apps might not be protected by the Battery Manager. This means they won’t run when your phone is off, and you won’t get notifications. This was extremely frustrating on multiple occasions, especially when people were trying to contact me on messenger apps.-No app drawer. It took me a while to figure out how to add an app icon.-Speaker is loud enough, but sound quality is poor and really tinny. This can make listening to some voices (especially high-pitched ones) really annoying. Good luck if you like listening to music, too.-No accessories besides a quick charger. It would be nice if the Honor 8 came with headphones, or an additional USB C-cable.-Other non-intuitive UI: When you slide down for Notifications, the Shortcuts (WiFi, Bluetooth, Flashlight, etc.) section needs to be clicked to access said menu. It’d be better to just have both Notifications and shortcuts combined on the same screen, like with stock Android.-I’m unaware of any profile options: for example, if I want to turn off vibrate and reduce my notification/media/call sounds in the office, I have to play with the volume buttons each time, instead of clicking on a Profiles shortcut to select Home/Work/Outdoors.-Volume and Power (restart/shut down) options can only be accessed with the physical buttons. It would help with UI if we can just slide down to the Notification/Shortcuts menu and be able to digitally manipulate the settings. This would also reduce wear and tear on the physical keys, and let users continue to use the phone if the physical keys break.**If the options I’ve mentioned above are available with EMUI, it just goes to show how unintuitive the UI is. There’s a lot to be desired in terms of intuitive controls, and I really hope Huawei will update EMUI as soon as possible.Final thoughts: The Honor 8 is a great phone that suffers from bad UI design. If EMUI were designed as beautifully as the Honor 8 phone itself, or were replaced with stock Android, I would not hesitate to recommend this phone to friends and family. As it stands, however, I can only recommend this phone for people who are intermediate to advance users, who either enjoy micromanaging their settings, or are comfortable with doing so. Given the Honor 8’s current EMUI, I would not recommend this phone as a gift for someone new to smartphones (parents, grandparents, etc.). I'm not happy to give such an average review, because the Honor 8 has great specs, price, and looks. It's just the UI that suffers. If Huawei improves the Honor 8’s user experience, they will have a complete package with no rivals at this price point. So best wishes to Huawei, and I look forward to be given a chance to provide an updated, higher-rated review in the near future!",1.0,after going through x lg g series phones in as many years due to lousy build quality bad touchscreen screen detachment bad motherboard boot loop issues i decided to abandon the brand as a consumer i prize build quality durability intuitive controls and bang for your buck to put things in perspective my favorite all time smartphone design is the motorola defy it was built like a tank and worked underwater it was rugged you could drop it and it would barely scratch no need for a phone case had minimal bloat wear and served perfectly as an every day carry edc workhorse unfortunately due to the current marketing strategy for cell phones phones like the defy are unicorns the market currently is littered with disposable consumer goods built to be glass houses so manufacturers can increase profit this led to a frustrating search high and low for a mid tier phone that had good reviews with a decent camera good build quality impressive specs for the money and a solid user interface ui experience that is until i came across huawei and the honor professional and amateur reviews i found were nearly universally positive pointing to a beautiful body design good customer support good camera good specs and compatibility with t mobile s band a lot of other chinese made and international version phones don t support band i started leaning towards purchasing an honor u s warranty but the one thing that held me back were the divisive love it or leave it attitudes towards huawei s emui then i heard they would be replacing emui in the near future and amazon featured a deep discount on black friday for the phone selling it under so i pulled the trigger and made the purchase i m about weeks into using this phone and while i want to love my honor as much as i did my defy huawei s emui greatly reduces my enjoyment and experience this is why i deducted two stars as emui is non intuitive and can be extremely frustrating when you miss notifications because of emui settings if and when huawei updates emui away from i will give an updated review pros the phone is relatively slim and great for one handed operation the phone is fast the screen unlocks as soon as you touch the fingerprint sensor and i haven t experienced lag on any apps battery life is really good i can go through my commute and work day without having to charge my phone the camera is decent quality minor lag at times when it s trying to focus and has friendly controls i ve been spoiled by lg s cameras but i feel the honor performs well beautiful external design but slippery definitely get a case for this phone if you don t want it sliding around vibrant display and transition times between dark brightly lit rooms is good the phone will turn on wifi to connect to a known network when you re in an area you frequent cons emui emui emui initial setup when switching from an old phone to the honor takes an extremely long time compared to stock android this is because emui has a bunch of settings you need to micromanage ranging from app permissions to notifications to battery use what i miss about lg is whenever i upgraded a phone i d just connect the two phones via nfc and everything would sync up settings continued rather than having everything default to being enabled you have to manually enable some settings this means if you re not careful some of your social media apps and email apps might not be protected by the battery

LG G3 D855 16GB Metallic Black Factory Unlocked 4G 3G 2G 2G GSM 850/900/1800/1900,LG,275.0,2,"Disappointing - I love the phone for the first day - such a nice upgrade vs my galaxy S2 - but then BIG software issue - even worse when I upgraded to Lollipop. factory reset - back to Kitkat - bit better but still not perfect. I ended up keeping my old phone but played with the G2 a bit more - and it is a disappointment overall. Software + hardware issues..not a great combo - LG you can do better I am sure! The screen is amazing to watch movies / pictures / browse and the battery life is pretty solid though. The vendor dealt with my issues swiftly though - appreciated it.Pros:* Gorgeous screen - if you can get your hands on 4K HD source it looks incredible. HD movies look also fantastic. This is one of the standout feature of the phone* Great camera* Good battery life (well, for a smartphone - I am still waiting for a smartphone that can last for 3 or 4 days straight)Cons:* BIG software issues: viber, whatsapp, facebook, any app that connects to the internet, are working on and off and wifi calling is often unavailable. the phone I received comes as an unlocked T-mobile phone with some T-mobile app that you cannot uninstall. Not a big deal in theory - but seems like the T-mobile settings get in the way of wifi calling* Other software issue - while in general the phone/android runs smoothly, once in a while the phones freezes / apps shut down / keyboard doesn't pops out when you want to type. Same things started on my Galaxy S2, after 3 years of use. Not right out of the box* SCREEN RESPONSIVENESS ISSUES. Every now and then the keyboard doesn't work. You type but nothing appears on the screen. My sister had a screen responsiveness issue with her LG G2 - the bottom home/back/switch buttons ended up not working after a while, while the rest of the screen was ok.

Verizon LG VX8300 No Contract Camera Cell Phone,LG,12.44,4,"I've had this phone for about a week. At first glance, it was so many lightyears better than the free phone T-Mobile had given me that I was overjoyed. Then I noticed some flaws. I'll summarize this as a pros and cons list.PROS - Fabulous reception. The last time I had Verizon it dropped nearly all the calls at my house, so I was taking a big chance switching back because of the phone. Even with 1/2 a bar the connection quality was excellent. I heard everyone much more clearly and everyone noted that they heard me better as well. And, in NY, Verizon has a better overall coverage area, so I was happy. So far, so good.I personally liked the way this phone feels next to my face and in my hand better than either the Chocolate or the Razr, but that's a matter of personal preference. For me the deal-killer with the Chocolate was the lack of speaker phone too.I also like the way the phone book is set up. Everything seems intuitive and well thought out in general.So far, so good, but the cons are a definite annoyance:CONS - 1. Horrible battery life. This phone has a battery life like phones of 5 years ago. You need to charge every night, even on standby. Don't forget to get a car charger and keep it with you with this phone. This is probably the most disappointing thing about this phone, especially compared to the Nokias my friends have.2. Horrible voice-commanded calling. I have yet to get this to work on the first shot. I bought a family plan so my elderly mother could use this - just push a button and say ""call..."" so she could call without having to figure out how to use the phone. I'm sorry that's not going to happen with this phone.3. Iffy speakers - if you make them loud, there is a lot of distortion, but if you put them on medium it's fine.4. Mp3 disabled - this goes under the general Verizon greed issue, but if you go to Ron's review, you'll see how to enable it - and you'll get annoyed when you see right on the phone that the ""mp3 disable"" is checked off. I enabled mine, so far so good.So, if all you need is great reception definitely get this phone. This phone has the best reception of any phone I've had. Judging by other reviews, this isn't the case across the board, but my particular phone gets good reception and has excellent voice clarity on both ends.And, beware, you CANNOT port your number and still get the equipment discount with any service provider on Amazon. However, there is a plus side on the Verizon end. You don't have to get bogged down in a 2 year contract anymore with Amazon either! That was good for me because I wasn't sure about the reception issue. So, I just called and emailed everyone with my new number, which is actualy easier to memorize than the other one was. I wrote this in a review that wasn't published, so lets see if they let this one slip in to this one. If not I'm complaining, because customers should know this before deciding whether to buy.So, overall I am happy with the general things about the phone, but LG needs to address the voice command and battery issues especialy with this model before it will get 5 stars from me. I can live with any other little annoyances.",19.0,i ve had this phone for about a week at first glance it was so many lightyears better than the free phone t mobile had given me that i was overjoyed then i noticed some flaws i ll summarize this as a pros and cons list pros fabulous reception the last time i had verizon it dropped nearly all the calls at my house so i was taking a big chance switching back because of the phone even with a bar the connection quality was excellent i heard everyone much more clearly and everyone noted that they heard me better as well and in ny verizon has a better overall coverage area so i was happy so far so good i personally liked the way this phone feels next to my face and in my hand better than either the chocolate or the razr but that s a matter of personal preference for me the deal killer with the chocolate was the lack of speaker phone too i also like the way the phone book is set up everything seems intuitive and well thought out in general so far so good but the cons are a definite annoyance cons horrible battery life this phone has a battery life like phones of years ago you need to charge every night even on standby don t forget to get a car charger and keep it with you with this phone this is probably the most disappointing thing about this phone especially compared to the nokias my friends have horrible voice commanded calling i have yet to get this to work on the first shot i bought a family plan so my elderly mother could use this just push a button and say call so she could call without having to figure out how to use the phone i m sorry that s not going to happen with this phone iffy speakers if you make them loud there is a lot of distortion but if you put them on medium it s fine mp disabled this goes under the general verizon greed issue but if you go to ron s review you ll see how to enable it and you ll get annoyed when you see right on the phone that the mp disable is checked off i enabled mine so far so good so if all you need is great reception definitely get this phone this phone has the best reception of any phone i ve had judging by other reviews this isn t the case across the board but my particular phone gets good reception and has excellent voice clarity on both ends and beware you cannot port your number and still get the equipment discount with any service provider on amazon however there is a plus side on the verizon end you don t have to get bogged down in a year contract anymore with amazon either that was good for me because i wasn t sure about the reception issue so i just called and emailed everyone with my new number which is actualy easier to memorize than the other one was i wrote this in a review that wasn t published so lets see if they let this one slip in to this one if not i m complaining because customers should know this before deciding whether to buy so overall i am happy with the general things about the phone but lg needs to address the voice command and battery issues especialy with this model before it will get stars from me i can live with any other little annoyances,ve phone week glance lightyear well free phone t mobile give overjoy notice flaw ll summarize pro con list pro fabulous reception time verizon drop nearly call house take big chance switch phone bar connection quality excellent hear clearly note hear well ny verizon well overall coverage area happy far good personally like way phone feel face hand well chocolate razr s matter personal preference deal killer chocolate lack speaker phone like way phone book set intuitive think general far good con definite annoyance con horrible battery life phone battery life like phone year ago need charge night standby don t forget car charger phone probably disappointing thing phone especially compare nokias friend horrible voice command call work shot buy family plan elderly mother use push button have figure use phone m sorry s go happen phone iffy speaker loud lot distortion medium s fine mp disable go general verizon greed issue ron s review ll enable ll annoy right phone mp disable check enable far good need great reception definitely phone phone good reception phone ve judge review isn t case board particular phone get good reception excellent voice clarity end beware port number equipment discount service provider amazon plus verizon end don t bogge year contract anymore amazon good wasn t sure reception issue call email new number actualy easy memorize write review wasn t publish let let slip m complain customer know decide buy overall happy general thing phone lg need address voice command battery issue especialy model star live little annoyance,4,0.754,Overall Experience

At this point I only really use it to access the internet and messenger. For this function it is good. For phone calls and skype it is nearly worthless. Especially skype or any app like snap chat it loads too slow. All videos are very pixalated. Even when I send them. Camera is also pretty crappy compared to other phones I have had. (Nexus 5, Samsung Galaxy3) Now that the memory is almost already full (in only 6 monthes) I have to restart it A LOT, apps crash a lot/ freeze and the camera has problems. I only purchased because I am living out of the country and wanted a cheap phone that I don't have to insure. For that purpose I believe it has met my expectations. Also can hold two sim cards which is very nice as I travel back and forth and need to switch carriers. Compared to cost of other phones that i have had before and comparing it's processing to it is good value. 1/5th of the price!!!! The appearance is very nice. Even the guy in the cell phone store thought it was an iphone 6. Also very durable and comes with a screen protector and case which is convenient and saves money. Battery life is good. I charge every night even though it never gets below 50% (unless I'm using constantly all day), also charges fairly fast.Don't get it you are expecting it to act like a $400 phone.

Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - Mint (U.S. Warranty),,249.99,2,"I have now owned my Robin for just under two weeks now.The good: The performance seems great - no lag that I can detect (I am coming from an iPhone 5s). Beautiful screen - bright and crisp. Build seems solid. Phone reception actually seems better than my iPhone 5s. And the phone is thinner than my iPhone 5s. I also really like the stereo speaker setup.Minimal packaging. Looks like the phone manufactures are finally getting it. I don't need a huge package with mostly air in it.The bad: Using a speaker or headphones when the phone is idle (e.g. when some music stopped playing, I just got off the phone, etc.) There is an annoying click that seems to happen about every second. When you unlock the phone, it stops, but soon as the screen shuts off, it begins. I can't tolerate it, and have to pull the jack. This does not appear to happen with a bluetooth headset.My camera has stopped functioning more than once now - requiring a power down to get it working again.Android. I don't want to be a hater, but come on, do I really need to give you permissions to things like location or microphone in order to use some of these apps that really don't need it? Yes, I am referring to built in delivered apps. Google, I don't care how much fluff and sugar coating you use to justify the gathering of my personal information. I want control over it. I am hoping that Cyanogenmod will help in this area if/when it arrives for the Robin.Battery life. The screen and phone seem to suck the juice out of this phone. I am unable to get a full day on a single charge. I have tried power management, but it does not seem to help much.Sound. Okay, I get that these are tiny speakers, but still not great.Something new that is happening - twice now the phone did not detect that I have raised to my ear to talk. The first time my cheek must have clicked the speaker phone button - which was a nice loud surprise. The second time I hung up on my call to find that I had somehow entered the notifications screen. Taking a star away.The pretty: Well, it is a great looking phone. I was an Apple fan because of form and function, and the Robin certainly covers the form side very well.Well that is my take after almost two weeks. I'll give it some more time to get comfortable and see if I can sort out the kinks before deciding if it is a keeper (or not).Update May 26, 2016: It is being returned. Too many problems with both the hardware and Android operating system. That along with Amazon not offering an exchange (requiring a return to the manufacturer if I want it repaired/replaced and a wait without a loaner). I wanted to like this phone.

I could never use it for ANYTHING without it turning itself off over and over again while trying to do the simplest task. I didn't want to give up on it, especially since I'd spent $80. So I kept using it. I actually bought it to use with an international carrier's SIM card while studying abroad. I got cell service, but the entire time I was unable to pick up ANY DATA. And when I tried to call my parents (as I'm a student living in a foreign country, knowing no one) the phone just shuts itself off FIVE TIMES in a 10 minute conversation.Some apps just would never work right, though on other phones people had no problems.I was forced to return it when the sound just stopped working completely. The phone wasn't even three weeks old and the sound just BROKE. So obviously I couldn't keep making excuses to keep the phone, I had to return it. What a waste of time and money.When I finally went out to the local (UK) shops to buy a new phone, every shop I went into said they don't carry LG phones because of the problems with them. That says something!DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.It was quite lovely, I would have really loved it if only it didn't shut itself off CONSTANTLY, drop my calls, refuse to pick up any internet, and the sound worked.Do not go through the hassle of buying this phone.

"Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Lime Gold (US Warranty)",Sony,399.99,5,"Having tried almost every recent Sony Xperia phone in the past 3 years or so, this is by far one of the best since the Xperia Z3 Compact. It's faster than the Z5 series (Antutu and everyday usage). Snappy, no lag, camera is soon much quicker and better photos. And unless you really want the water proofing or care for benchmarks, no reason to get the thicker and bulkier X Performance variant. I don't do games on the phone so the processor is more than enough and feels just as fast as any other phone in daily usage.The screen and design puts it on the same level as other flagships. Curved and flush with the bezels, smooth and feels premium. I have an iPhone 6S as well and I finally feel the Sony has that same polished and feel when you hold it in your hand. Price could be a little cheaper but Sony is always a little pricier than others.

"Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",Sony,173.0,2,"If you are a power user, don't buy this phone.For comparison, i had a blackberry 8800 that I wanted to replace.Bottom line up front: Don't buy it. I'd rather take a risk on the HTC Touch Pro 2 if you can wait for it on your carrier/afford it unlocked. Or wait longer and see what android phones come out.Rather than bore you with discussion of why I originally chose the n97, lets just get into my experiences:Major Issues:1. It no longer receives text messages except when sending. (This is within a month of buying)2. The exchange email sync locks up regularly and normally has to be manually sync'd when it is working. Also, notes doesn't sync at all for me.3. Even if you install everything to the phones 32GB memory, the phones small internal memory still fills up causing the phone to basically lock up.4. I find myself rebooting the phone regularly to get it to work.5. The web browser becomes unresponsive while loading pages (so if 1 picture on the page isn't loading, you can't browse the rest of the page. I find myself regularly waiting for pages to load rather than reading what is already loaded.) Also, even when loaded pages don't scroll around very well.6. The software availability is much less than I expected. Maybe I'm just bad with google, but it seems like most the programs I want are from the US. And US developers seem to develop in this order: 1. iphone 2. blackberry 3. windows mobile. They just don't develop for s60. For some reason I can never fine the European equivalent of the programs I want. Also, very few programs seem to have been updated from s60v3 to s60v5 so even if someone HAS done the software, it doesn't necessarily work on this phone. That includes most of nokia's own software.7. Battery life is not enough to make it through an entire day if you're using it regularly throughout the day. It'll make it if you leave it in your pocket while you're at work, but if you leave it on your desk, (say because work blocks all the websites you want to visit), you better plan to have it plugged in the whole time.8. The call log stopped recording so I can't see who called me any more.9. I have to leave it on vibrate so it doesn't ring at work yet can rarely actually feel it ring. I don't know if it's not vibrating or just so week I can't tell but I miss 100% of the calls I get when I'm not looking directly at it.10. The phone app does not interact well with any other app so you'll likely screw up a call if you're in an app when you get it. Alternately I regularly have trouble actually hanging up. I don't think the red button on the bezel works the same as the ""end call"" soft button.11. It takes at least 3 clicks to do basically anything whether it's run a program, view a contact or pick who to send a text message to. nothing is well laid out.Minor issues:1. All the configuration options are buried, obscured or unavailable. It's a hunt to try and configure anything.2. The Facebook app requires 2 clicks just to tell it 'yes you can connect to the internet' every time you open it. (This is pretty consistent. Everything wants your personal interaction to tell it how to connect to the internet. This is easy: if available, use wifi, if not use cellular. With AT&T there are another 2 or 3 options I don't even understand.)3. The Facebook app stopped loading pictures.4. It doesn't come with a password keeper and all the options are mediocre on this phone. (There are 3 or 4 options but none I consider acceptable. I could do an entire post on whats wrong with the different password keeper options.)5. Ovi Store doesn't let you re-download programs. It knows you've bought them but it won't let you reload them.6. The podcast program doesn't automatically download your podcasts in the background and it doesn't save your spot in them. (However, I found out if you play the podcasts through the music player it will save your spot as long as you don't play anything else in between.)7. The screen does not redraw well8. The music player is mediocre at best. It seems I have to dig down to the song just to play anything. I'd like to hit 'play' and have some random song play. This is an acceptable player for maybe 2 or 3 years ago. Today people expect a reasonably thought out interface.9. The rss reader is built into the web browser and has to be dug down to. Why can't I just hit an RSS app and have my RSS's, updated, at my fingertips?10. Ok, I know below I throw a bone to the keyboard, but it's quirky. I regularly hit the 'right' key on the d-pad when trying to type which sends my cursor to the front of the text, (where I then type half a sentence before realizing it). Also, I regularly confuse the 3 'alt' keys, (which you'll use regularly). This slows me down and causes me to retype a lot. Also, I'll get an 'alt' key locked in place and type a whole sentence in numbers and symbols.11. Just can't find a reasonable game for it. I just want a simple RPG to keep me busy when I don't have a cellular connection but can't find one that will install.12. The cut and paste are very poorly implemented.That said, it's not a completely terrible phone1. In general, all the hardware is good. They've got a decent platfrom, their just abusing it with terrible software.2. I get a TON of use out of the 32gb of memory. It's just like having a 32GB memory stick with you as long as you've got the cable.3. I like podcasts on my phone. If the software was a bit better it'd be perfect. I let them download in the background and then play them in my car whenever I drive, (and all things considered and morning addition aren't on).4. At least it can kinda sync. It brought over my exchange contacts and calendar. That is pretty nice though I'm not sure it's actually sync'ing changes backwards.5. I like the integration between the GPS, the Nokia 'locations' program, google maps, etc. There's even a program to GPS tag your photos.6. The camera takes great photos and reasonable video. Qik is cool for streaming/sharing video online.7. The keyboard isn't bad inherently. The keys are definitely ok to type on.8. Size and feel of the phone are pretty good. The flip up is great.9. The widgets are nice though I don't use the facebook (I had it up for a bit but I never really cared about anything it was showing me) or the weather (the weather has a solid background which is an ugly contrast to most other widgets that are semi-transparent) widgets.10. It makes a great modem for a laptop, whether as a wifi access point or as a tethered modem. That said, I wish the hardware supported WPA because, being at DEFCON this week, WEP is just asking someone to crack it.Hope this helps others avoid a very expensive mistake. I'll probably try and sell it on ebay and go back to my 8800 while I wait for AT&T to get the HTC Touch Pro 2. I just hope it's not crippled in some way.",4.0,if you are a power user don t buy this phone for comparison i had a blackberry that i wanted to replace bottom line up front don t buy it i d rather

"Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U.S. 3G, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and 4 GB MicroSD Card--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",Nokia,79.0,3,"I bought this phone because I saw a friend had it and he did a good job selling the features. I got the international unlocked version. Plus this phone was used in Batman The Dark Knight movie. Phone sold for $280 plus tax.What can I say, when I bought the phone over 5 years ago it was a good phone to use to browse the Web, watch videos and most importantly listen to music, that's were it shined. Hence the name XpressMusic. The phone had a good MP3 player as well as an AM/FM radio tuner that did a decent job scanning local stations when the antenna was attached. The antenna was in the guise of Nokia's earphones. Build quality of the earphones was poor though. They fell apart after about a year of normal use. Nokia used to be a great product 6 or 10 years ago along with Blackberry. But then iPhone, Samsung, LG got into the market and made a superior quality product as far as the technology, design , build quality, ease of user use and application and customer support. Nokia fell behind the tracks. Could not keep up with the demands of the US market. Nokia was good if you lived in Europe, Asia and Africa but not the Americas. Issues with Symbian, lack of apps, memory and the fact that Symbian decided to bow out of the game and let Nokia look to Windows as an Operating System for their phones and tablets was a mistake in my eyes. Strengths of the phone; Good build quality, durable, good battery, Music and media player and GPS. Weakness; Symbian OS, lack of apps in Ovi Store, Stability of apps, would crash due to bugs in apps,security issues not enough memory,lack of Customer Support for Nokia and Symbian in Northern America.",0.0,i bought this phone because i saw a friend had it and he did a good job selling the features i got the international unlocked version plus this phone was used in batman the dark knight movie phone sold for plus tax what can i say when i bought the phone over years ago it was a good phone to use to browse the web watch videos and most importantly listen to music that s were it shined hence the name xpressmusic the phone had a good mp player as well as an am fm radio tuner that did a decent job scanning local stations when the antenna was attached the antenna was in the guise of nokia s earphones build quality of the earphones was poor though they fell apart after about a year of normal use nokia used to be a great product or years ago along with blackberry but then iphone samsung lg got into the market and made a superior quality product as far as the technology design build quality ease of user use and application and customer support nokia fell behind the tracks could not keep up with the demands of the us market nokia was good if you lived in europe asia and africa but not the americas issues with symbian lack of apps memory and the fact that symbian decided to bow out of the game and let nokia look to windows as an operating system for their phones and tablets was a mistake in my eyes strengths of the phone good build quality durable good battery music and media player and gps weakness symbian os lack of apps in ovi store stability of apps would crash due to bugs in apps security issues not enough memory lack of customer support for nokia and symbian in northern america,buy phone see friend good job sell feature get international unlocked version plus phone batman dark knight movie phone sell plus tax buy phone year ago good phone use browse web watch video importantly listen music s shin xpressmusic phone good mp player fm radio tuner decent job scan local station antenna attach antenna guise nokia s earphone build quality earphone poor fall apart year normal use nokia great product year ago blackberry iphone samsung lg get market superior quality product far technology design build quality ease user use application customer support nokia fall track demand market nokia good live europe asia africa america issue symbian lack app memory fact symbian decide bow game let nokia look window operating system phone tablet mistake eye strength phone good build quality durable good battery music medium player gps weakness symbian os lack app ovi store stability app crash bug app security issue memory lack customer support nokia symbian northern america,4,0.43,Overall Experience

Samsung Galaxy S4 SGH-I337 Unlocked GSM Smartphone w/ 13 MP Camera - Red (No Warranty),Samsung,288.89,5,"I needed a new smartphone since my iPhone's battery was acting stupid (although, a few months after I bought this Apple recalled my phone for battery issues and now it working great...). When it comes to Android there are so many choices. I chose Samsung since it is about the best contender in the Android market. They frequently update and their software is great. I compared this to Sony Xperia Z and the HTC something (comparable model, but do not remember which). I chose the Samsung mainly for price and battery. I got the AT&T version (at the time this item was listed as AT&T version), it appears to no longer be listed that way. I use Net10 and like not having a contract, so I have to be proactive in finding a great deal on smartphones (no carrier subsidy). I got this for around $300, which is great for this new of a smartphone. It not the current version, but now a days nothing you every buy will be. The specs are still great and it has amazing speed and battery life.The phone has great audio (one of the reasons I chose this over the Xperia Z), the sound is super loud and even out does my iPhone 5. I was disappointed that my iPhone headphones would not work properly in this (could hear and talk, but could not skip or change volume). You do get some nice headphones with this, but I cannot wear the kind that sticks in your ears, they always fall out, and my iPhone headphones have an adapter that makes them over the ear. This is not related to the phone, but Android is annoying with the headphone volume warning.During my time using the iPhone, I have gotten used to Siri. I tried the Samsung program, but it was not that great. I then found Google search and started using it. Not that easy, since you have to disable some stuff to get Google to be the default voice assistant. After some research and messing around I finally got it where I can use Google search and the OK GOOGLE. At first OK GOOGLE worked all the time, but randomly it started only working when I had the phone active (screen had to be on).The camera is amazing on this phone, it offers a lot of neat filters and special shots, but truthfully you are going to use the normal camera, which takes amazing photos (if you change it to 4:3 you can get the highest resolution, not default). I have played with the camera features, and while they are cool, they require more prep than normal use (getting subject ready...), so I do not use them often, more of a 'check out what my phone can do' thing.Stock browser is terrible, use Chrome. Chrome is great, and I am not sure why they still even load the stock browser. Chrome works as expected and is super fast. You can sync with desktop Chrome (linked to your account) and I have not had any issue browsing the web, ""Request Desktop Site"" is about the most useful feature ever for mobile browsers. There is no Flash, but that has been long removed, and most sites have moved on, so not a big deal to me.When I got the phone I spent a lot of time removing the crap apps, these are the apps that AT&T loads and Samsung loads, and that you will never use. They are also made where you cannot remove them (I am not rooting). You can at least disable/hide them from launcher and that makes life a little better. I think I should be able to remove any apps I want (that would not cause the OS to become unstable).I was able to update to KitKat after a painful waste of time dealing with the AT&T updater. Apparently you cannot update except with OTA. Everytime you try to update, if it fails you will get a check again in 24 hours. Really annoying. I found that you can change system time 24 hours in the future and it will let you check. I had to do this several times until I could finally get it to work and say Android KitKat was available... Do not go crazy jumping into the future; just do the minimum each time, so when it finally works, you are not locked out for years... You could always repeat this process for future updates, but it is still annoying.I find Samsung Kies useless. Just put the Micro SD card into the computer and copy your stuff over to it (Movies, Music), and pop it in the phone. If you want you can copy it from the phone to local storage, but I personally keep apps on internal storage and images/music/movies on the SD card. This works great for me.Fancy features on the phone are endless, and for the most part not going to work. All of the fancy voice commands and gestures are very sporadic and sometimes work. The only one I find useful is the wave your hand over to get a quick view, it looks cool in meetings and shows you a quick glance of content. I have not used any of the other features and I did try, but most just stopped working properly. A cool feature I was looking forward to was the eye detection (look away and the movie pauses). I found it often doing the opposite, look away it keeps playing, look back at phone it pauses. I found it more pausing when I tried to watch than anything. I disabled this. Cool in theory, but I guess it cannot detect my eyes properly.This has Google Play and Google Services, which is really the only way to enjoy an Android based device. Without those you will not be able to use Google apps and other apps that rely on Google services. This allows this device to use the Amazon Appstore (great for free apps and loads of giveaways and free credit) and Google Play, the home of pretty much all Android apps.It does offer a feature where you can use split screen with certain apps and can put some content on the bottom and other on top, this is a neat idea, but a screen this small does not make it all that useful. I keep it off, but made it one of my main items in the notification center, so I can enable it quickly if I need to type an email while looking at a webpage or something.I am not going to go over the petty problems I have with Android (like difficulty of quickly seeing emails, and my hatred of the primitive notification system), because it is tough going from iOS to Android, and apparently Android L will fix most of my problems, and this being a Samsung device it will probably get the update pretty quick (I would say Samsung is about the quickest with Android updates).The battery life on this phone is amazing and it works great, I do keep it in Power Saver Mode all the time, and I do not see any different in use vs regular mode. By the end of the day I usually still have 30-50%, and only when I was at the airport playing games for several hours, did I ever get below 10% at the end of the day. You can also keep a spare battery on you which is nice, I personally have a backup battery device that allows me to plugin.Games on this are amazing! I have been playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and it is super clear and fluid with no lag. The device handles it amazingly and it looks and feels the same as it did playing the game on my PS2. I will note playing games will drain the battery, but that is expected (as the CPU,GPU and screen are all working overtime).All of the regular things works as expected, GPS works great, Bluetooth works great (it has Bluetooth 4, but very few apps offer the same level of support as they do for iOS), screen offers great brightness, but is easy to see and work with in very low levels (for battery saving). I have not had any issues with WiFi or cellular. I use Net10 with an AT&T based SIM and I have full LTE service and speeds are as expected. MMS and SMS work (if coming from iOS, be sure to disable iMessage or your iPhone friends cannot message you). The device arrived unlocked (it was an AT&T branded device), and accepted a T-Mobile SIM with no issue.Comparing Specs to the Galaxy S5, I would not pay the price difference. I am happy with this and it is a great phone. It was much cheaper than any current S5 deal, and if you are like me using prepaid, this is a great choice for a super amazing phone that is affordable and gives you the power you need. I am happy with this phone and highly recommend it! Compared to the other Android devices you will most likely not find as many accessories or get as fast of updates as you will with a Samsung flagship phone, even if it is a previous model.",51.0,i

"POSH MOBILE KICK ANDROID GSM UNLOCKED DUAL SIM 5.0"" SMARTPHONE with unique colorful design, FULL-sized display, 5MP Camera and 8GB of Storage. 1 Year warranty. (Model#: X511 GOLD)",Posh Mobile,85.06,5,"I decided two years ago to never again pay more than $100 for a phone, as I believe it is better to put my money into a good tablet or laptop. I don't use my phone for games, and only put on it the most essential apps, since these ""free"" games and apps have access to all your contacts, phone logs, email, and location. I have plenty of other tablets and laptops to play games on whenever I want. I use my phone for calls, texts, and occasionally email.I love the Windows phones, but they appear to be dying, so I looked for my next replacement. I couldn't decide on this or the Blu Amazon phone, so I got both. My plan was to use the Posh for my audio books (which I listen to constantly), and the other one as my phone. I bought this more as a joke than a serious phone, and at $30, why not? The small size seemed ideal for me, as I spend a lot of time walking my two Golden Lab pups through the woods, and I have too much gear packed into my Scottevest already.I opened up both phones, set up the Blu, which is bigger than any other phone I have been using, and seemed very limited. I was not at all impressed.Then I set up the Posh, and fell in LOVE with it. It doesn't have a ton of memory, but has plenty for what I need it for. It even fits perfectly in the license ID holder in my vest, and weighs next to nothing. I decided to use this as my phone instead.The only hard part was the one time log in to my essential accounts, the keyboard is tiny. I can't imagine typing text messages on it, but it works just fine using the microphone. For most things you can use the microphone instead of the keyboard. Which I'm sure is why they call it a ""Micro"" phone.Just as I got it all set up, I dropped it on concrete. Yup, shattered the screen. It is still usable, but I decided to replace it because I like it that much.I logged in to buy another one, only to find the price had gone up to $50. It seems other people also liked this phone, and demand had driven the price up.If it ever comes back to $30, I'm buying a case of them. They would make great gifts. And I'm sure I will drop it again, as I am a klutz.But even at $50, it is a great deal.",1.0,i decided two years ago to never again pay more than for a phone as i believe it is better to put my money into a good tablet or laptop i don t use my phone for games and only put on it the most essential apps since these free games and apps have access to all your contacts phone logs email and location i have plenty of other tablets and laptops to play games on whenever i want i use my phone for calls texts and occasionally email i love the windows phones but they appear to be dying so i looked for my next replacement i couldn t decide on this or the blu amazon phone so i got both my plan was to use the posh for my audio books which i listen to constantly and the other one as my phone i bought this more as a joke than a serious phone and at why not the small size seemed ideal for me as i spend a lot of time walking my two golden lab pups through the woods and i have too much gear packed into my scottevest already i opened up both phones set up the blu which is bigger than any other phone i have been using and seemed very limited i was not at all impressed then i set up the posh and fell in love with it it doesn t have a ton of memory but has plenty for what i need it for it even fits perfectly in the license id holder in my vest and weighs next to nothing i decided to use this as my phone instead the only hard part was the one time log in to my essential accounts the keyboard is tiny i can t imagine typing text messages on it but it works just fine using the microphone for most things you can use the microphone instead of the keyboard which i m sure is why they call it a micro phone just as i got it all set up i dropped it on concrete yup shattered the screen it is still usable but i decided to replace it because i like it that much i logged in to buy another one only to find the price had gone up to it seems other people also liked this phone and demand had driven the price up if it ever comes back to i m buying a case of them they would make great gifts and i m sure i will drop it again as i am a klutz but even at it is a great deal,decide year ago pay phone believe well money good tablet laptop don t use phone game essential app free game app access contact phone log email location plenty tablet laptop play game want use phone call text occasionally email love window phone appear die look replacement couldn t decide blu amazon phone get plan use posh audio book listen constantly phone buy joke phone small size ideal spend lot time walk golden lab pup wood gear pack scottevest open phone set blu big phone limited impressed set posh fall love doesn t ton memory plenty need fit perfectly license d holder vest weigh decide use phone instead hard time log essential account keyboard tiny t imagine type text message work fine microphone thing use microphone instead keyboard m sure micro phone get set drop concrete yup shatter screen usable decide replace like log buy find price go people like phone demand drive price come m buy case great gift m sure drop klutz great deal,4,0.885,Overall Experience

With a European model phone you don't get all the 4G bands unless you are on the at&t network. Thankfully I am on at&t and didn't have to return the phone. Plus it would of been super inconvenient if I had to return it seeing as I was in need of a phone pretty bad. I just don't like the fact that if I wasn't on at&t I could have been screwed and I don't appreciate that deception.",1.0,the actual phone is great no issues love everything about it i would recommend it the stars is for the seller amazingdeals shipin day noussalestax first the phone is not mint it s actually not green in any way it actually is called ice blue per google which is fine i like blue too just was looking forward to a mint phone second the seller says it s a us model h it s not it s the european model h with a european model phone you don t get all the g bands unless you are on the at t network thankfully i am on at t and didn t have to return the phone plus it would of been super inconvenient if i had to return it seeing as i was in need of a phone pretty bad i just don t like the fact that if i wasn t on at t i could have been screwed and i don t appreciate that deception,actual phone great issue love recommend star seller amazingdeal shipin day noussalestax phone mint s actually green way actually call ice blue google fine like blue look forward mint phone second seller say s model h s s european model h european model phone don t g band t network thankfully t didn t return phone plus super inconvenient return see need phone pretty bad don t like fact wasn t t screw don t appreciate deception,4,0.32,Overall Experience

"LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smart Phone, 5.2"" Ice Blue, 32GB Storage, US Warranty",LG Electronics,325.0,5,"The phone itself is amazing, one of the downsides is the features available with this device for marshmallow.... There is no clear all button in recent app window, this means you have to clear each app one by one. Other devices with marshmallow have this clear all button but for some reason LG and Google opted out of it. If you want this phone but hate that missing feature, then buy the phone and sign up for new Android operating system : Android N. Google is doing a beta right now for the new Android OS. Sign up takes less than a minute and the update will be sent to your phone immediately. Android N beta has the clear all recent apps button. After doing some research, I found out that repeatedly closing apps throughout the day causes the memory suffer greatly and this will ultimately affect battery life. So I guess not having the clear all apps button isn't really a loss but more of a gain.If you don't like the new Android N beta, simply opt out and the latest marshmallow OS will be sent to your phone to download.The only hardware issue I've had is getting the sim card tray open. It took forever and finally worked when I inserted the tool at an angle.Lots of people complain about battery life. First and foremost, give it a couple days. Marshmallow will settle and your battery will calibrate accordingly.Others will complain( including me ) about Wi-Fi problems.

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty),Sony,304.14,2,"I purchased this phone due to the higher end specs of the phone in the smaller form factor. At first I was disappointed to learn that they removed the fingerprint reader from the power button, but I quickly got over that since I hadn't had it yet in my prior phones. Overall I enjoyed the phone at first. The form factor was good along with several other aspects. I didn't appreciate all of the Sony specific software that was on it, but I was able to overlook that for a while.

"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,149.99,1,"I've been a loyal Blackberry customer since 2003, first as a lawyer in a large law firm, and now as a lawyer in government. I've owned four different Blackberries before I bought the Classic.I have owned the Classic for a little over two months. For the first two months, it was great. I upgraded from a pretty old Bold, so the bigger scree, touchscreen and BB10 were all very welcome. It was also very fast, and a really nice device.About two months after I owned it, it starting getting streaks in the display. this is the first Blackberry I've every had a problem with. I called Blackberry. They are very nice, but rather than believe me that there was a hardware problem, I had to reload the software, send screenshots, etc. They tell me the RMA department has to help me. But apparently only three people work in that department, because they're never available. But after two days of run arounds, I finally talk to someone who agrees that they will send me a new one. They take my credit card number, which they will charge if I don't return the old one. OK, I understand.Then the fun begins. While I get an email with an RMA form, they never tell me the tracking number of the new device. They tell me on April 2 that it will ship in 3-5 business days. I call today (April 6) to get the status -- they don't know. They can tell me that it will ship by April 10, but have no further information. The phone is now useless, and I need it for work. And I have to wait 10 days?This is ridiculous. I could buy a new one on Amazon and have it tomorrow. How can it take 10 days to even ship the device? How can they not now the status when I call? The people I talk to are perfectly nice, but also perfectly useless. This is no way to run a business that is supposed to cater to business users.So I have two concerns - (1) quality-this is the first Blackberry of mine that's ever had a problem, and I've had four different ones over the last 12 years, and (2) customer service, which has so far been useless.",26.0,i ve been a loyal blackberry customer since first as a lawyer in a large law firm and now as a lawyer in government i ve owned four different blackberries before i bought the classic i have owned the classic for a little over two months for the first two months it was great i upgraded from a pretty old bold so the bigger scree touchscreen and bb were all very welcome it was also very fast and a really nice device about two months after i owned it it starting getting streaks in the display this is the first blackberry i ve every had a problem with i called blackberry they are very nice but rather than believe me that there was a hardware problem i had to reload the software send screenshots etc they tell me the rma department has to help me but apparently only three people work in that department because they re never available but after two days of run arounds i finally talk to someone who agrees that they will send me a new one they take my credit card number which they will charge if i don t return the old one ok i understand then the fun begins while i get an email with an rma form they never tell me the tracking number of the new device they tell me on april that it will ship in business days i call today april to get the status they don t know they can tell me that it will ship by april but have no further information the phone is now useless and i need it for work and i have to wait days this is ridiculous i could buy a new one on amazon and have it tomorrow how can it take days to even ship the device how can they not now the status when i call the people i talk to are perfectly nice but also perfectly useless this is no way to run a business that is supposed to cater to business users so i have two concerns quality this is the first blackberry of mine that s ever had a problem and i ve had four different ones over the last years and customer service which has so far been useless,ve loyal blackberry customer lawyer large law firm lawyer government ve own different blackberry buy classic own classic little month month great upgrade pretty old bold big scree touchscreen bb welcome fast nice device month own start get streak display blackberry ve problem call blackberry nice believe hardware problem reload software send screenshot etc tell rma department help apparently people work department available day run around finally talk agree send new credit card number charge don t return old ok understand fun begin email rma form tell track number new device tell april ship business day today april status don t know tell ship april information phone useless need work wait day ridiculous buy new amazon tomorrow day ship device status people talk perfectly nice perfectly useless way run business suppose cater business user concern quality blackberry s problem ve different one year customer service far useless,2,0.502,Camera Quality

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Blue) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,103.94,2,"This may seem really ridiculous but I ordered this last week and got it Saturday. Before I got it activated the other night the screen was messing up on me. I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully. If not, it's either just not meant for me, I got a lemon, or I should just curse the fact that I have big fingers.

Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty),Sony,199.99,1,"So after long deliberation about my first smartphone, I chose the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua. I have had Sony Ericsson phones before that were very sturdy so I was hoping for something similar. My husband trusted my judgement, and also needed a new phone, so we ended up ordering two. We've had them for seven weeks now;Frankly, I am very disappointed. If I have one word to describe this phone, it would be: slow. I did not install that much apps or anything, but when switching on the phone, it just takes a long time. Also, when opening social media apps like whatsapp or facebook, it just keeps switching off and on while you are typing, extremely annoying. Taking a picture of something that is not a still object, is practically impossible. It takes 3-4 sec to take the shot, which is a very very long time. So you end up always missing that one moment. And when you take the picture, after a few seconds you see a frame being 'saved' but this is not the picture you end up with. So blurry pictures are now a big part of my library, unfortunately.Even worse with the video recording - without any sign that something is wrong, they can end up completely black. I was taping two of our friends saying 'I do' at their wedding, and afterwards it turned out there was absolutely nothing on the tape (you did see that something was taped though, and I could 'play' it, but as said, it is completely black). Next video I tried turned out fine - no idea why. But again, I missed the big moment because of the phone.When someone calls and you just touch the screen somewhere to pick up the phone, you are disconnected most of the times.My husband's phone stopped working after five weeks of light use - microphone did not work in 4 out of 5 times. He had to ship it to be looked at and has to miss his phone 15 business days without any replacement. This is completely unacceptable for a brand new phone! He should just get a new one, if you ask me.Also, be careful when placing the phone in your pocket, because the back tends to become really, really hot- almost too hot to touch at one point. Can not be healthy to walk around with, close to your body.And the last thing I do not like is the fact that it is too big for my hands, but that's just because I have rather small hands.What do I like -- I like the design- I like the fact that it's water proof, however did not put this to the test yet- I like the the ringtones- I definitely like the battery life (two days easily), takes at least 6 hours to recharge though.But I would not recommend it to anyone.UPDATE: in looking for a solution for the videos always turning out black - I found that this is an issue that is often reported and well know to Sony. Their only solution is to restart the phone. Then 1 or 2 videos can turn out OK.",9.0,so after long deliberation about my first smartphone i chose the sony xperia m aqua i have had sony ericsson phones before that were very sturdy so i was hoping for something similar my husband trusted my judgement and also needed a new phone so we ended up ordering two we ve had them for seven weeks now frankly i am very disappointed if i have one word to describe this phone it would be slow i did not install that much apps or anything but when switching on the phone it just takes a long time also when opening social media apps like whatsapp or facebook it just keeps switching off and on while you are typing extremely annoying taking a picture of something that is not a still object is practically impossible it takes sec to take the shot which is a very very long time so you end up always missing that one moment and when you take the picture after a few seconds you see a frame being saved but this is not the picture you end up with so blurry pictures are now a big part of my library unfortunately even worse with the video recording without any sign that something is wrong they can end up completely black i was taping two of our friends saying i do at their wedding and afterwards it turned out there was absolutely nothing on the tape you did see that something was taped though and i could play it but as said it is completely black next video i tried turned out fine no idea why but again i missed the big moment because of the phone when someone calls and you just touch the screen somewhere to pick up the phone you are disconnected most of the times my husband s phone stopped working after five weeks of light use microphone did not work in out of times he had to ship it to be looked at and has to miss his phone business days without any replacement this is completely unacceptable for a brand new phone he should just get a new one if you ask me also be careful when placing the phone in your pocket because the back tends to become really really hot almost too hot to touch at one point can not be healthy to walk around with close to your body and the last thing i do not like is the fact that it is too big for my hands but that s just because i have rather small hands what do i like i like the design i like the fact that it s water proof however did not put this to the test yet i like the the ringtones i definitely like the battery life two days easily takes at least hours to recharge though but i would not recommend it to anyone update in looking for a solution for the videos always turning out black i found that this is an issue that is often reported and well know to sony their only solution is to restart the phone then or videos can turn out ok,long deliberation smartphone choose sony xperia m aqua sony ericsson phone sturdy hop similar husband trust judgement need new phone end order ve seven week frankly disappointed word describe phone slow install app switch phone take long time open social medium app like whatsapp facebook keep switch type extremely annoying take picture object practically impossible take sec shot long time end miss moment picture second frame save picture end blurry picture big library unfortunately bad video recording sign wrong end completely black tap friend say wedding turn absolutely tape tap play say completely black video try turn fine idea miss big moment phone call touch screen pick phone disconnect time husband s phone stop work week light use microphone work time ship look miss phone business day replacement completely unacceptable brand new phone new ask careful place phone pocket tend hot hot touch point healthy walk close body thing like fact big hand s small hand like like design like fact s water proof test like ringtone definitely like battery life day easily take hour recharge recommend update look solution video turn black find issue report know sony solution restart phone video turn ok,4,0.75,Overall Experience

But that is not any convenient feature I was looking for!I had hard time in adding contacts or notes. Searching contacts by scrolling is very challenging and you need to get used to some 'special skills'.Overall, I am going to use this only to make calls and nothing else. This phone is not good at all for texting or even surfing internet (If you take 3G plan, you can use internet in this phone). Browsing is something terrible to do in this phone.If you are looking for browsing (3G) feature along with calling and texting, this is not a good phone.I am using it only for voice calls and I am going to dump it in future.",0.0,touchscreen is terrible you need to press the screen really hard to get the correct thing done otherwise it will stay dumb i used to have iphone before for years and i got this one only to get rid of dataplan as i was not using dataplan much this phone doesn t need to have dataplan and that s the only good thing about this phone other things like crystal clear home screens which change every time the phone is in locked position makes it look something interesting but that is not any convenient feature i was looking for i had hard time in adding contacts or notes searching contacts by scrolling is very challenging and you need to get used to some special skills overall i am going to use this only to make calls and nothing else this phone is not good at all for texting or even surfing internet if you take g plan you can use internet in this phone browsing is something terrible to do in this phone if you are looking for browsing g feature along with calling and texting this is not a good phone i am using it only for voice calls and i am going to dump it in future,touchscreen terrible need press screen hard correct thing stay dumb iphone year get rid dataplan dataplan phone doesn t need dataplan s good thing phone thing like crystal clear home screen change time phone lock position make look interesting convenient feature look hard time add contact note search contact scroll challenging need special skill overall go use call phone good texting surf internet g plan use internet phone browsing terrible phone look browse g feature call texte good phone voice call go dump future,4,0.95,Overall Experience

Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9005 32GB 4G LTE WHITE Unlocked International Version,,313.05,5,"We all know that the new Galaxy note 3 is the talk of the town but some people whom want the phone but don't want to get roped into a contract will purchase an unlocked version of the phone. But before you buy the unlocked version their is some information you need to know about the different models of the phone(s). The Galaxy Note 3 was released in many country's on every continent. Although anyone can buy the phone from any country; each model was made to work on different frequencies. In this review I am going to go over each model of the Galaxy Note 3 and the services recommended for use with them.But First everyone may be asking about the Region lock attached to the phones. Yes before the phones are unlocked their are region locks attached to the different models forcing them to only accept SIM cards from their designated country's. But after unlocked the Region locks are removed. Does this mean that all models will work everywhere, no, but I will be going over if the phone will work in your region after the locks are removed in the model descriptions below.Second the different levels of service. Depending on your area and the service towers available their you will get different letters to indicate service level and the speed you're getting. Below are the most common levels and their average speeds in order for your reference during the Model review.1. E = EDGE/GSM: When getting this sign you are getting the weakest signal for your phone but are still getting non-roaming signal for general calls and text. I advise if this is your areas mane signal strength you have a Wi-Fi signal avalible for the data internet conection.2. G = 2G/GSM: When the G is showing you are getting remedial signal but still pretty strong. Calls and Text's will be flawless and you will be able to do general internet surfing but you will not be loading any HD videos or have perfect connection to online only game's. With this I still recommend a Wi-Fi signal in your house if you plan on using the internet in these areas.3. H = 3G-/HSPA: This signal is classified as 3G but runs a little slower depending on how close you are to the main tower. If you're getting a good amount of bars with signal will do flawless calls, text's, and you'll be able to comfortable able to surf the internet and load videos at a max of 480P (360P recommend for best result).4. 3G = 3G+/GSM/HSPA: This is the full 3G speed and will be also flawless with calls, text's, and be able to stream video like netflix(Recommended 460P), play online games, and surf the internet fast and easy.5. H+ = 4G-/GSM/HSPA+: This is the signal that most first generation 4G phones use. Perfect for all light movie watchers, and small business people. Flawless calls, text's, and the internet is speedy. H+ although fast has been known to be faulty in a lot of area's and was quickly replaced. If you've got this signal it's still 4G but it's kind of like the EGDE version of 4G.6. 4G = 4G/GSM/HSPA+: This is the 4G signal that most 2010-2012 4G phones use such as the Galaxy S series (Sept for the S4) Although this is a very fast and reliable it is not LTE but for the average person whom just watched movies and plays online games on their phone this signal is more than enough to give you a crisp fast feel and load HD movies (720P Recommended but not limited to.)7. 4G LTE = 4G+/GSM/LTE: This is the current signal that everyone is going after. It is lighting fast and is the most reliable for non-stop videos, gaming, and downloading.Now for the common phone models:1. SM-N9000 3G = International/Made for Travelers: This is the international model. This one has a dual quad core processor running at 1.9 GHz Cortex/1.3 GHz A7. The reason for the processor being change is because this phone is meant to work everywhere their is a GSM signal and kicks threw the different processors to maximize signal strength. The N9000 CAN NOT to 4G speeds of any kind. This is due to most country not having 4G signal and that a lot of county's run on different cell frequencies. By removing the 4G radios this phone can pick up way more cell frequencies then the other models. This phone is not made for people looking for Data speed this is made for travelers whom want a reliable way to have cell service no matter where they are. Don't despair about the data or processing speed this phone still has Wi-Fi connection available and can breeze though 3D games; you shouldn't even notice a speed difference when doing tasks.2. SM-N9005 4G LTE = European Model/International: This model contains the regular 2.3 GHz Snapdragon Processor. This phone unless unlocked is Region locked to only European SIM cards, after unlocked their is no region lock. Although this phone is an LTE phone it can only get LTE frequencies while in Europe. When you take this phone out of Europe it will get international signals but will not get LTE, when this phone is in the USA is will get H+ (Reference above) signal maximum.3. SM-N9002 3G = China Model/Select Counties: This model is not LTE or 4G compatible. This was the First generation of the Note 3 released and is considered the Beta. With all the same hardware as the LTE version this phone will still preform flawless tasks.4. SM-N900W8 4G LTE = China Model/Select Counties: This model will only get LTE in select counties and I advise you check with your service provider to see what signal you will be getting. This model is completely subjective as to what frequencies of LTE you will be about to get. Example: Imagine you are in Europe and you are in a city and get LTE. Then you move to another city and you lose LTE this is because the first city runs on an LTE frequency the the phone can get but the second city although may offer LTE to most cell phone; does not offer LTE on a frequency this phone can't run on.5. SM-N900A 4G LTE = USA AT&T/Worldwide: This phone is International but you need to consult AT&T to see if you city or county can get LTE service or not. This phone once unlocked will work on Straight Talk, Solavei, T-Mobile, and any other GSM based network. Note: When using T-Moble, Solavei, or other services that piggy-back on the T-Mobile towers you can get LTE service but depending on your area you may not get 3G. If you live in a 3G area consult your carrier to see is the frequencies for 3G match up with this phone. (This review for the AT&T model can change at anytime due to AT&T's bootloader)6. SM-N900T 4G LTE = USA T-Mobile: This phone when unlocked can get all USA frequencies. Example: You will have no problems using a AT&T SIM card with this phone and even get 4G LTE threw any service whom provides is. The N900T model is the most versatile model out of them all and if you plan on getting one I recommend going to a T-Mobile store and purchasing this model outright. Unlocking this phone is easily done threw calling T-Mobile and even using YouTube for an unlocking video.So out of all the models the N900T is the most versatile, but unlike the N900A (The second most versatile) the N900T is harder to find online already unlocked so you will most likely need to buy if from the store and unlock it yourself.I hope this review has helped with you decision about what unlocked version to buy.If you have an questions or addition to the review please leave a comment.Video review of phone Specs and features coming soon.",308.0,we all know that the new galaxy note is

BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Grey,BLU,129.99,3,"It's close to stock, but they changed the launcher to be like the Apple iPhone where all the home screens are just a grid of your installed apps. While some may like that, I did not, so I installed the Google Now Launcher app to get a more traditional Android launcher.BLU also changed the notification shade. At first I was confused at why notifications was categorized as Important and Other, but then while looking at notification settings, I realized what was going on and how I can set installed apps to be Important or not. I do miss stock Android's second swipe-down of the notification shade to get Quick Settings.The phone is responsive enough, plenty of storage space, uses micro-SIM card rather than nano-SIM, has a good camera, and interesting enough actually came with a cover and a screen protector in the box. The phone is good enough that I may recommend this phone to someone I know who is not very technically inclined and their current Android smartphone is almost three years old.One concern though is whether BLU will ever upgrade the phone. It has an old version of Android 5.x Lollipop and so far I haven't seen it get even the monthly Android security updates from Google.

CNPGD [U.S. Warranty] All-in-1 Smartwatch and Watch Cell Phone Red,CNPGD,49.99,4,"I thought I put a review in since there wasn't any when I bought this.I've had the watch for about a week and so far its meeting most of my expectations. Out of the box, it has a nice finish. Looks well built and holds a nice weight to it but not too heavy on the wrist. The rubber strap looks good and is surprising comfortable. My wife is not one that observes details but when she saw the watch, the first thing she said was that the strap was well made. The watch face is simple, touchscreen, micro USB on the right and a home button that rattles when I shake the watch.Setup wasn't too difficult. The watch has a QR code u can scan to download the BT notifier apk. I've installed the app in my GS3 and Acer Iconian tablet. Sync was OK but I seem to have issues with remote camera control. There are a few apps out there that will work. There's one by mediatek available on google play or u can just google BT Notifyer and get the version for the U8. I found the U8's version worked best with all the sync and features working correctly. It takes a micro Sim card and a micro SD card.Once paired via bluetooth, u get about 10 ft of distance from your phone or tablet before the watch warns you about losing connection. I also paired a Bluetooth headset to the watch to play music. In my experience, the watch is a great Bluetooth receiver but sucks at emission. Playing music from the watch to my headsets (both Jabra and Soundbot) was scratchy, music breaks up every now and then, and the watch is only on my wrist, not feets away. I had hoped to take this for runs and play music off it, but the transmission to my paired headset was so bad, I'd get tired of the music before I tire from my run. There are some inbuilt apps, the pedometer, a calculator, a calendar, remote camera capture, an FM radio and music player.I like that the watch doubles as a phone, i had wanted to get an emergency phone for my spare SIM so with this, i got that and a smart watch. I like how the watch feels and the touch screen is suprisingly sensitive. I wished telling time wasn't a two handed affair, you have to hit the home button to trigger the watch face. Be nice if it responded to the gyro momements of my wrist like what the pedo does. You only get notifications on emails, so you can't read the whole thing off your watch, just the title. There is no support for other messenger apps like FB messenger, we chat or wassap. You get notified but you can't reply without whipping out your phone. Then again typing on the 2"" watch screen isn't the most efficient way of replying a message.But to me the biggest fail is in the watch's pairing with Bluetooth headsets and speakers. I want to love this watch but this one downside just doesn't make it perfect. But hey, for a 50$ price tag, I think its good enough for my money. I bought this to experience the whole wearable technology thing, like a starter watch before deciding on throwing more money into android wear devices. So far its doing what its designed to do and doing it well. Overall i am pleased with it but becoz I don't intend to do the whole dick Tracey thing and talk into my watch, the weak pairing to my headsets loses a star.",84.0,i thought i put a review in since

The Super AMOLED HD screen brings the movies to life. Its like watching on those Jumbotrons in Times Square. More like a portable Jumbotron. The colors just instantly pop off the screen with some adjustments. Just turn the 'outdoor viewing' setting ON in the video settings and the colors get supersaturated. Also works with pictures. And battery life is outstanding, only problem is it puts a little weight on it(but all batteries do). The speaker is loud and vibrant which is awesome but its located at the bottom, which sounds a bit uneven when watching a movie. But overall this phone is a beast. I recommend watching a movie with lot of color like speed racer to test out the screen.A LMFAO music video will also help.

Verizon 4G LTE Moto Luge by Motorola Prepaid Smartphone,Motorola,94.99,5,"My Droid is so durable and though it came with Jelly Bean it can be easily updated to KitKat. There are many hidden features that you may want to play with including face unlock, Droid Zapp which is a feature that if one opts to do so can incorporate on the Motorola Droid network for additional features. The model is sleek slim and resistant to water, corrosion, and drops. The speed is relatively much faster than some other 4G phones.

I can complain that Play Services can get frustrating in being a battery hog on this phone at times,... that and Media Services too. But, with some light tinkering I got to work around it. A change in settings and disabling apps I don't use solved that quick! The Xperia UI is clean and aesthetically pleasing without too much excessive bloatware (TouchWiz... *cough-cough*). I have found at least 70% of the additional features useful to some extent ESPECIALLY the powersaving features. The camera is also extremely good for being a ""mid-tier"" phone, having a 13MP and all. Also, as for the design of the exterior is great, having the right curves and angles as well as waterproofing/dustproofing.... The removable battery and the MicroSD card slot is a very much more welcome addition!!!So far, I love it! Sony didn't have to try too hard, and I am very impressed!

Despite the desperate need to look fly, I'm ballin on a budget. Riding broke bitch status, ya feel me? Anyway. I read review after review of the Posh Titan HD 550 and all seemed positive. Watched unboxing videos and reviews on YouTube and decided to go with this phone. I was elated the day it arrived. Couldn't wait. Selfie time. BAM! watched me!After a few days of use I noticed the phone started to slow down. Touch screen response time was under-par and the camera was...frankly it was s*** and the beauty cam feature was comical at best. The phone boasts a 13mp camera but what is that when the display can't give justice to its own features? The video even lagged like a ghost trail of I was recording my daughter playing or even opening gifts on her bday.Battery life was the WORST of any smart phone I've ever owned. My phone stayed on the charger constantly. And if it died, you can forget it. An overnight charge was lucky to get you 70%. It did do this weird quick charge thing where it went from 5% to 100% in 10 minutes but then without warning it would die before I'd even get home and that was with the phone just on standby.Hated it.

After a few days use, the Mate 7 beats the iPhone 6+ hands down:1. As a phone, the Mate 7 picks up network signals much MUCH better (we use TMo). In our weakest spot at home, our old iPhones used to have one bar, the Mate 7 now has 2 bars, but the iPhone 6+ just dances between no bar and 1 bar. Why the 6+ couldn't even do a better job than our old iPhones really lost me!2. Data speed, when using TMo (turning off Wifi), the Mate 7 gets 30+M down and 16+M up in most areas of our home (still 10+M in that weak spot). iPhone 6+ gets only 5M in the best spot. All using OOKLA Speedtest.3. Everyday use speed, the Mate 7 is vividly faster than the iPhone 6+ in every test we can throw at them side by side.4. Music, that's supposedly Apple's area of strength. We are no audiophiles, but by our layman or laywoman's ears, the Mate 7 sounds better than the iPhone 6+.5. Fingerprint logon, the Mate 7 wakes up the phone with just one touch but the 6+ needs two (home then fingerprint). The Mate 7 is also more sensitive and no fail.6. Google Map, tap on an address, the Mate 7 automatically brings us to Google Map. That's the one thing we missed the most ever since Apple kicked out Google Map replaced with its own map (yeah, we always downloaded Google Map and used it, but missing THAT AUTO LINK!!)

I am tired of paying ridiculous prices for new phones and having them break all the time. Warranty is too expensive and only cover a couple of times. And half the time buying an older or used phone it ends up having something bad that I didn't know until long time use or it dies on you. So I though I would give this a try. The quality of these phones are actually decent and they work really well. They do not have the Bloatware (T-mobile apps, AT&T Apps, Verizon Apps, Etc) that most phones and thus makes it seem fairly fast. Long time I am not sure how long these will last but at a range of $200 or $300 for some, it is not life or death if they fall and break as compared to those $600-700 phones that you get in the store.

I paired it with my iPhone 6s and I liked that I was able to get notification alerts. However, the alerts pushed any notification that came through my phone and the maximum amount that it shows on the watch is 5. Every time I got any sort of alert it would say I have 5 new messages even when I only had one new one and the rest were old. You can't reply back to anything and the UI is laggy. The watch interfaces had a small selection and none of them were to my liking. The phone option is probably the best working part about this and the option I would use the least. You can actually call directly from the smartwatch, there is a dial pad, speaker, and mic. When using the Siri​ option, it works ok but it acts as if you are calling yourself.

Unlocked Quad-band S29 Smart Watch Phone Micro SD Card SIM Card Bluetooth Wrist Smartwatch Smart Mobile Phone (Golden),,59.99,5,"Update: 4-6-2016TL;DR: Upgrading to 5 stars. This is a great watch for the money. CNPGD did a great job once again. If you want a sharp looking round-face design smart watch on the cheap, then this is a very solid build with excellent screen and feature set. You might need a different app for Android 5.0+ than what it comes with. Dig below for the app description.UPDATE: Take the time to install the right app. There is no way this is a 2 star smart watch unless you are expecting it to have a feature set other than what it actually is: a smart watch. It's not a phone watch, it's not a hybrid calling watch, it's just a fantastic little smart watch.By request - ALL the details:This watch has a lot going for it, with a couple of nit-picky cons. Let's start out with my device specs: UPDATE: Phone switch to - Digital Reign Journey Phablet with Android KitKat. Keep this in mind during the following information regarding the app, etc.# First thing is ... the mobile app that goes with the watch. It has a QR code built into the watch. Scan it and grab the app. Very nice looking app. I found one I like even better called ""TRULY SmartDevice"" - it is nearly identical in appearance and functionality, plus it works perfectly with the watch using my phone/tablet. If the scanned app doesn't work for you, go grab the one I mentioned and you will be all set. 100% all notifications push for the Android. I do not own Apple products to test for you sorry. Also, this app has a 'scan' feature. If you have trouble using in combo with a headset, just check on Scan, and choose your watch. Probably got switched to your headset when it connected. Done.UPDATE: TRULY SmartDevice app allows the install of weather applet. Works great. Wish there were more applets!# Construction of this watch is top notch. Metal housing, plastic back and face/screen, and magnetic charger make this look and feel first rate. Lots of compliments in the first two days of wear. Not a flawed bevel or 'squeezable' creaky seam to be found.UPDATE: I have really put this poor thing through its paces lately and it has stood up to some real abuse. Heavy rain, got beaten against a door frame several times hauling equipment around, wasn't paying attention scrubbing up and completely doused it in the sink (at which point it powered off by itself and I thought I had fried it! Dried it off and it has worked ever since.), etc. Still works like a champ.# Bluetooth connectivity is great. What's that mean? I mean it is solid. Stable. Great range. Freaky range actually. I have a PLT_Legend Headset which has amazing range, and I will hear 'beep... phone 1 disconnected' right before I start feeling my wrist vibrate to warn me it is losing signal. Works great with headsets by the way.# Charged this on the first day in about 1.5 hours from 'low battery' warning to full charge. I have been playing around with it quite a bit, playing music, taking and making calls with it for fun, and I get a LOT of messages, emails, skype, case notifications via specialized apps, etc. as a contractor just in regular use.UPDATE: I am changing this to an average of 3 days. You will get anywhere from 2 to 4+ days depending on how much it gets used. Really, it is up to you how much life you get out of it, but either way - you'll never have to worry about battery life. It's incredible.# No battery draining extras. This is what it is: A Smart Watch. No SIM card slot, No TF slot, nothing. Just give you notifications and has a few nice apps like Pedometer and such that seem to work ok. I've tested it all (aside from 'Siri' since I don't own Apple stoofs) and it all appears to work as it should.# Sound is simply fantastic. If CNPGD is good at anything - this seems to be it. Louder than any name brand watch I've messed with, crystal clear, and music reproduction is pretty amazing. Outright enjoyable to listen to in fact. Microphone works well according to the several people I tested it with.# The wristband is very nice quality. The underside is an almost suede texture making it very comfortable to wear, but read on to see one nit-pick that you should know about below.-> Lastly, there are a couple of things you should know before buying just in case any of these might be a deal breaker for you:# If you have large wrists, you will have to buy a longer wristband. I have what I would consider medium to even smallish wrists for a man. I am using the *last* hole on the band and I mean it is exactly comfortable. Any shorter and I wouldn't be able to wear it.UPDATE: Most moto360 bands can be modified to use with this. Leather bands are super easy to just widen the gap a bit. Metal bands are pretty simple to just use band itself and set pins - most of the link gaps are wide enough.# If you are partial to a digital display (i.e. large numbers displayed like 12:15 PM instead of an analog clock) then this will not work for you. There are 5 different watch faces, all of them are nice in their own way and a couple of them are downright amazing. However I am surprised there is no 'digital watch' option for viewing the time. Keep this in mind when ordering.UPDATE: This remains my only gripe, although it is not an issue since a couple of the faces I really like as it is.Overall, I am really enjoying this watch so far and will give regular updates as time goes on just as I did with my previous CNPGD watch. I will miss it dearly as it served me without fail for over a year's brutal abuse by my person. It's final accidental crunch under my foot gives way to this new adventure.UPDATE: So far this watch is every bit the gem my previous model was. I'm really on board with CNPGD products at this point. Bang for your buck, this is hard to beat.",6.0,update tl dr upgrading to stars this is a great watch for the money cnpgd did a great job once again if you want a sharp looking round face design smart

However, my daughter shattered the screen on the phone and it stopped working, so I purchased this as a cheap replacement.This phone is such a piece of junk.First of all, it isn't unlocked, as it clearly states in the title. I contacted the seller who told me that the phone is ""GUARANTEED"" to be unlocked. It isn't. I was planning on using SIMple Mobile SIM card for this phone and canceling my AT&T plan. However, the SIMple card wouldn't work, and I have been forced to continue with AT&T for the time being.Seller, can I please have the UNLOCK CODE?!Secondly, this phone is so buggy. After connecting to Zune on my computer and waiting over an hour for the Mango update to install, it didn't fix all the issues.The most annoying of the various bugs, which seems to be the phone itself, not the OS, is that the touch screen will freeze and become completely unresponsive. You can't power the phone down to reset it, because in order to do so you have to simultaneously hold down on the power button and swipe the screen down..but if the screen is frozen you can't do that, so the only way to fix it is to take your phone case off, pry off the back of the phone (which is a PAIN IN THE BUTT. Ladies, I hope you don't value your fingernails, because you'll lose them trying to take this phone apart.) and remove the battery.This happens to me at least twice a week.This phone is really heavy.

Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 64GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,299.0,5,"Ok, I love this phone. I recently destroyed my Samsung Galaxy S5 and needed a replacement. I didn't like the S6 and didn't want to commit to another 2 year contract for the S7. Then I found this little guy. Oh, man! I've had it for about a week now and I still love it. Battery life is great and recharges quickly when depleted. I love the camera, the slow motion video, the ""expert camera"" mode. You know what else I love? I love that the FM radio receiver (which all smart phones have) is not disabled. I can listen to FM radio without using an app that uses data like Iheartradio or something would use. True, it's only local stations, but that's not the point. The point is that the manufacturers include a radio in your phone that your carrier decides to disable to protect their monopoly on your data. Here's another good thing about this phone: it's unlocked. So you can use it on whatever carrier you want. Take it abroad, use it in a different country just by switching SIM cards. How can you not get behind that?My wife uses a Samsung Galaxy Note3 and she loves it. But when it gets time to replace it she's going with one of these babies because she sees how much I enjoy it. She may not appreciate all the technical advantages this phone has over others, but she does like the looks, form factor and interface. In short, it's a joy to use.",35.0,ok i love this phone i recently destroyed my samsung galaxy s and needed a replacement i didn t like the s and didn t want to commit to another year contract for the s then i found this little guy oh man i ve had it for about a week now and i still love it battery life is great and recharges quickly when depleted i love the camera the slow motion video the expert camera mode you know what else i love i love that the fm radio receiver which all smart phones have is not disabled i can listen to fm radio without using an app that uses data like iheartradio or something would use true it s only local stations but that s not the point the point is that the manufacturers include a radio in your phone that your carrier decides to disable to protect their monopoly on your data here s another good thing about this phone it s unlocked so you can use it on whatever carrier you want take it abroad use it in a different country just by switching sim cards how can you not get behind that my wife uses a samsung galaxy note and she loves it but when it gets time to replace it she s going with one of these babies because she sees how much i enjoy it she may not appreciate all the technical advantages this phone has over others but she does like the looks form factor and interface in short it s a joy to use,ok love phone recently destroy samsung galaxy s need replacement didn t like s didn t want commit year contract s find little guy oh man ve week love battery life great recharge quickly deplete love camera slow motion video expert camera mode know love love fm radio receiver smart phone disabled listen fm radio app use datum like iheartradio use true s local station s point point manufacturer include radio phone carrier decide disable protect monopoly datum s good thing phone s unlocked use carrier want abroad use different country switch sim card wife use samsung galaxy note love get time replace s go baby see enjoy appreciate technical advantage phone like look form factor interface short s joy use,4,0.533,Overall Experience

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty,Huawei,399.99,5,"So far so good. I am coming from a Nexus 5 and needed an upgrade. I tried the Pixel and it was an amazing phone, loved the simplicity of Google phones but not the price. I ended up returning it because I couldn't bring myself to spending $850 on a phone, which brought me here. Was going to buy last years Nexus 6P but I read that Huawei came up with a better and newer phone this year.After reading review after review, the consensus has been good battery, good camera, fast, and unfortunately a bad OS. I was really worried because I have grown really fond of plain android over the last 3 years but the cyber sale was too good to pass up. When I got the phone, I was immediately turned off by the lack of an app drawer so after about 30 mins with the phone I downloaded the Google Now launcher and all was well!!! I also downloaded all of the standard google apps (gmail, photos, messanger, calander, keep, clock...) while uninstalling as much of the bloat as possible (good thing Honor comes pretty bare). I read up on the net about all of the buried settings to enable/disable apps from running in the background while off. Now the phone runs great, and I can barely tell its a not plain android, except the notification setting pull down as it takes some getting used to.This phone is very fast and has a great camera, not as good as the pixel but it was about 500$ less I think I can live with it! The fingerprint sensor is crazy fast and I love that you can set it up as a shortcut for different tasks, especially because the power and volume being on the same side of the phone made taking screenshots one handed very difficult. Now I can set my fingerprint double tap to take care of that.Time will tell if this phone holds up, I'm still concerned about the possibility of not getting security updates or OS updates but we'll see. For now I am happy about my purchase. If anyone is reading this and is on the fence, just do it!!!",4.0,so far so good i am coming from a nexus and needed an upgrade i tried the pixel and it was an amazing phone loved the simplicity of google phones but not the price i ended up returning it because i couldn t bring myself to spending on a phone which brought me here was going to buy last years nexus p but i read that huawei came up with a better and newer phone this year after reading review after review the consensus has been good battery good camera fast and unfortunately a bad os i was really worried because i have grown really fond of plain android over the last years but the cyber sale was too good to pass up when i got the phone i was immediately turned off by the lack of an app drawer so after about mins with the phone i downloaded the google now launcher and all was well i also downloaded all of the standard google apps gmail photos messanger calander keep clock while uninstalling as much of the bloat as possible good thing honor comes pretty bare i read up on the net about all of the buried settings to enable disable apps from running in the background while off now the phone runs great and i can barely tell its a not plain android except the notification setting pull down as it takes some getting used to this phone is very fast and has a great camera not as good as the pixel but it was about less i think i can live with it the fingerprint sensor is crazy fast and i love that you can set it up as a shortcut for different tasks especially because the power and volume being on the same side of the phone made taking screenshots one handed very difficult now i can set my fingerprint double tap to take care of that time will tell if this phone holds up i m still concerned about the possibility of not getting security updates or os updates but we ll see for now i am happy about my purchase if anyone is reading this and is on the fence just do it,far good come nexus need upgrade try pixel amazing phone love simplicity google phone price end return couldn t bring spend phone bring go buy year nexus p read huawei come well new phone year read review review consensus good battery good camera fast unfortunately bad os worried grow fond plain android year cyber sale good pass get phone immediately turn lack app drawer min phone download google launcher download standard google app gmail photo messanger calander clock uninstalle bloat possible good thing honor come pretty bare read net bury setting enable disable app run background phone run great barely tell plain android notification setting pull take getting phone fast great camera good pixel think live fingerprint sensor crazy fast love set shortcut different task especially power volume phone take screenshot hand difficult set fingerprint double tap care time tell phone hold m concerned possibility get security update os update ll happy purchase read fence,4,0.769,Overall Experience

I have owned Otterbox brand defender series now for all my phones and two purchased for my iphone6s. I just upgraded to the Iphone6 plus (yay!) and briefly thought about going with an commuter series Otterbox because the phone is already huge! However I remembered my past phones and the destruction they faced in any other decorative case. I read the reviews and they were mixed. I received it and put it on my phone and it was very similar to the past Otterboxes I've had, easy to install. I love the screen protector and the home button has a plastic covering as well, however sensitive enough for the fingerprint scanner to work great! Love that everything is covered up except the cameras,front and rear. The colors are really cute and I love the teal/jade combo. I read other reviews that there was a lot of space between the corners and phone, but I did not have that issue, mine fits like a glove. Overall I love this case and will only have my phone in an otterbox. You get what you pay for. I want the best to protect my phone. I BOUGHT this for PERSONAL use. I was not asked to do a review.

BLU Tank II T193 Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone with Camera and 1900 mAh Big Battery - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - White Blue,BLU,26.41,2,"I purchased this phone because I was going to be visiting Montreal, QC and my primary phone doesn't work there. I researched a simple, unlocked phone compatible with networks outside the US and came across the BLU Tank. Based on the description, I should have been able to purchase and install a SIM card for any GSM carrier to use the phone.My local friend took me to a mall with several cell phone kiosks and shops. One by one they scanned the phone's barcode or looked up the serial number and determined that the phone was incompatible. Virgin Mobile, Koodo, Fido, and Rogers at the mall. I later found out Virgin uses AT&T's network and Koodo uses Telus. AT&T and Telus are CDMA networks in Canada, so that's on me. But Fido uses Rogers network, which is GSM. Even the Rogers shop itself told me the phone was incompatible with their network.I next tried a Best Buy. Their prepaid service in Canada is Chatr, which is also through Rogers and so its a GSM network. In true Best Buy fashion, they ended up presenting me with a Catch-22. They said they couldn't determine if the BLU Tank was compatible with Chatr unless it was activated. But, they couldn't activate it unless I purchased a SIM card and minutes. I wasn't about to buy something that the store didn't even know would be compatible, so I left.Perhaps there's a carrier somewhere in Montreal that would have worked with this phone, but I didn't find it. This phone is advertised for international use and compatibility, yet it doesn't seem to work with any GSM networks.In terms of hardware, its a simple design and looks like it would have been worth the price if I had gotten it activated. If you plan on traveling with this phone, I guess you should expect to spend a day calling major wireless providers at your destination to determine compatibility.",4.0,i purchased this phone because i was going to be visiting montreal qc and my primary phone doesn t work there i researched a simple unlocked phone compatible with networks outside the us and came across the blu tank based on the description i should have been able to purchase and install a sim card for any gsm carrier to use the phone my local friend took me to a mall with several cell phone kiosks and shops one by one they scanned the phone s barcode or looked up the serial number and determined that the phone was incompatible virgin mobile koodo fido and rogers at the mall i later found out virgin uses at t s network and koodo uses telus at t and telus are cdma networks in canada so that s on me but fido uses rogers network which is gsm even the rogers shop itself told me the phone was incompatible with their network i next tried a best buy their prepaid service in canada is chatr which is also through rogers and so its a gsm network in true best buy fashion they ended up presenting me with a catch they said they couldn t determine if the blu tank was compatible with chatr unless it was activated but they couldn t activate it unless i purchased a sim card and minutes i wasn t about to buy something that the store didn t even know would be compatible so i left perhaps there s a carrier somewhere in montreal that would have worked with this phone but i didn t find it this phone is advertised for international use and compatibility yet it doesn t seem to work with any gsm networks in terms of hardware its a simple design and looks like it would have been worth the price if i had gotten it activated if you plan on traveling with this phone i guess you should expect to spend a day calling major wireless providers at your destination to determine compatibility,purchase phone go visit montreal qc primary phone doesn t work research simple unlocked phone compatible network outside come blu tank base description able purchase install sim card gsm carrier use phone local friend take mall cell phone kiosk shop scan phone s barcode look serial number determine phone incompatible virgin mobile koodo fido roger mall later find virgin us t s network koodo use telus t telus cdma network canada s fido use roger network gsm roger shop tell phone incompatible network try good buy prepaid service canada chatr roger gsm network true good buy fashion end present catch say couldn t determine blu tank compatible chatr activate couldn t activate purchase sim card minute wasn t buy store didn t know compatible leave s carrier montreal work phone didn t find phone advertise international use compatibility doesn t work gsm network term hardware simple design look like worth price get activate plan travel phone guess expect spend day call major wireless provider destination determine compatibility,0,0.501,Battery & Performance

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Black),Apple,714.65,5,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)",75.0,if anyone is interested to know how the performs compared to the and scamera is a little better and you notice it for sure it is a lot better in low lights conditions speed i was using a s and i notice a much snappier safari and imessage screens part of it may be ios but pages pop really fast it is way way faster than the original black looks awesome but is is so slick there are no lines and it looks like a solid piece product i saw the glossy jet black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches so most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important mainly if you want a white front or black i love the new home button took about minutes to get use to and i don t miss the old home button at all any case with a large camera cutout like the cm wallet case works with the but most likely all other will not some of mine i can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out but i promise you this phone is slippery when dry overall i love it fastest device that i have ever used i can out type the s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem g is perfect in size for most everyone hardcore photo and video people may want the g no headphone jack doesn t bother me at all the adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones it s not really that large either the lightning headphones sound really good to me i tested the same song with the same headphone using a s and the with the adapter and i cannot tell the difference in some ways the with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process so beside have a little while cable sticking out i think the audio is fine iphone s se and users will feel a huge speed increase the s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me no matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price you ll pay full price for any of the phones it is all just creative math by the vendors i bought mine outright and got point on my credit card enough to reduce my price by i also heard the black and jet blacks maybe high in demand hope this helps,interested know perform compare scamera little well notice sure lot well low light condition speed s notice snappy safari imessage screen io page pop fast way way fast original black look awesome slick line look like solid piece product see glossy jet black work art fine scratch people use case hide maybe color important mainly want white black love new home button take minute use don t miss old home button case large camera cutout like cm wallet case work likely cut old camera hole use new case come promise phone slippery dry overall love fast device type s review thiamine problem g perfect size hardcore photo video people want g headphone jack doesn t bother adapter sound fine expensive headphone s large lightning headphone sound good test song headphone s adapter tell difference way adpater sound cleaner little aliasing hiss analog digital conversion process little cable stick think audio fine iphone s se user feel huge speed increase s far speed wise noticeable matter split payment upgrade contract price ll pay price phone creative math vendor buy outright get point credit card reduce price hear black jet black maybe high demand hope help,4,0.616,Overall Experience

Now, looking at the other reviews, I am confused. The phone either hugely diminished in quality, or people just had vastly different experiences. The phone feels very cheap first of all, due to the plastic cover. Although it is nice of Blu to provide a case (although this just becomes annoying from the amount of times you have to take out the battery since the cover comes off with the case).However, the phone's start up was extremely inconvenient. The worst I've ever had with any phone. When it started up, the phone was extremely slow. It took several minutes for it to do anything. Several apps did not work, I was unable to get to the settings without the phone shutting off. The phone itself often froze and was unresponsive. I had to take the battery out several times. The Google play store also did not work for several hours.Worst of all, the phone was unable to recognize my SD card and instead deleted all of its contents. The wifi is also terrible and disconnects frequently.I hate to write this negative review because I genuinely thought this phone would be a steal due to the several reviews online I watched on Youtube. However, I doubt anyone conducting these video reviews actually used the phone regularly. Also, any credible website gives this phone around a 3.8-4.3 out of 10.

"BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone - 5.5-Inch Display 4G LTE GSM Unlocked, GREY",BLU,199.95,4,"Added Review Notes: 10/7/20161. I'm not happy about the screen reading my finger touches. I feel like I'm constantly having to tap multiple times to get something to open and especially when I'm trying to go back a screen. My Note 3 never gave me this trouble.-- Update 11/9 - I removed my screen protector and I get better finger recognition and response.... except for the 3 menu buttons at the bottom of the device. Those are a bugger for me. I feel like the touch-area is too small or precise and area.2. I'm not sure if it's my network, but I don't feel like the 4G download speeds are as fast as they should be. I've always known that AT&T has crap service in Minnesota, but I find myself waiting and waiting on things to download frequently.Overall, still a nice phone, but taking my rating down from a 5 to a 4. Still a good solid B+ phone.Will keep updating as I continue to get used to this new phone.My Review Notes from 9/25 -My last two phones were the Samsung Galaxy S3 and Note 3, so my opinions for comparison are formed off my experience with those phones.0. I love the fingerprint unlocking feature!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1. The screen size is great. The resolution and picture is crystal clear and very bright!2. System runs fast so far, but I'll need to see how it responds after I load it up with my apps.3. Sound isn't as good as the Note 3, but it is fairly good. I give the sound B.4. The download speed rocks on my 5GHZ wireless connection. (I'm insanely shocked by how dang fast this was)5. AT&T is my service provider. The download speed with the 4G LTE isn't super fast where I live so I can't give a fair review of this.6. As with all phones, it's loaded with software that I do not use. Hoping to hide most if it in a folder so it doesn't clog up my real-estate.7. Update (11/9) - had earlier complained of Blue Tooth issues. Whatever was happening stopped. I've had great BT experience for the past 2 months.Overall, it's a great phone and I am really excited. I almost complained that the speakers sucked, but I found a clear sticker on the back that I forgot to remove that was blocking the sound! Don't forget to remove that dang sticker!!!Side note - The back button is on the same side of my phone as my Samsung Galaxy's. Not sure why someone was complaining about this. Works as expected from my perspective.Notable differences that I liked better about my Samsung Galaxy Note 3:Note had SSD slot for additional storage.Note had removable battery.Note had leather(ish) back cover that wasn't as slippery.",25.0,added review notes i m not happy about the screen reading my finger touches i feel like i m constantly having to tap multiple times to get something to open and especially when i m trying to go back a screen my note never gave me this trouble update i removed my screen protector and i get better finger recognition and response except for the menu buttons at the bottom of the device those are a bugger for me i feel like the touch area is too small or precise and area i m not sure if it s my network but i don t feel like the g download speeds are as fast as they should be i ve always known that at t has crap service in minnesota but i find myself waiting and waiting on things to download frequently overall still a nice phone but taking my rating down from a to a still a good solid b phone will keep updating as i continue to get used to this new phone my review notes from my last two phones were the samsung galaxy s and note so my opinions for comparison are formed off my experience with those phones i love the fingerprint unlocking feature the screen size is great the resolution and picture is crystal clear and very bright system runs fast so far but i ll need to see how it responds after i load it up with my apps sound isn t as good as the note but it is fairly good i give the sound b the download speed rocks on my ghz wireless connection i m insanely shocked by how dang fast this was at t is my service provider the download speed with the g lte isn t super fast where i live so i can t give a fair review of this as with all phones it s loaded with software that i do not use hoping to hide most if it in a folder so it doesn t clog up my real estate update had earlier complained of blue tooth issues whatever was happening stopped i ve had great bt experience for the past months overall it s a great phone and i am really excited i almost complained that the speakers sucked but i found a clear sticker on the back that i forgot to remove that was blocking the sound don t forget to remove that dang sticker side note the back button is on the same side of my phone as my samsung galaxy s not sure why someone was complaining about this works as expected from my perspective notable differences that i liked better about my samsung galaxy note note had ssd slot for additional storage note had removable battery note had leather ish back cover that wasn t as slippery,add review note m happy screen read finger touch feel like m constantly have tap multiple time open especially m try screen note give trouble update remove screen protector well finger recognition response menu button device bugger feel like touch area small precise area m sure s network don t feel like g download speed fast ve know t crap service minnesota find wait wait thing download frequently overall nice phone take rating good solid b phone update continue new phone review note phone samsung galaxy s note opinion comparison form experience phone love fingerprint unlocking feature screen size great resolution picture crystal clear bright system run fast far ll need respond load app sound isn t good note fairly good sound b download speed rock ghz wireless connection m insanely shock dang fast t service provider download speed g lte isn t super fast live t fair review phone s load software use hop hide folder doesn t clog real estate update early complain blue tooth issue happen stop ve great bt experience past month overall s great phone excited complain speaker suck find clear sticker forget remove block sound don t forget remove dang sticker note button phone samsung galaxy s sure complain work expect perspective notable difference like well samsung galaxy note note ssd slot additional storage note removable battery note leather ish cover wasn t slippery,4,0.887,Overall Experience

Apple iPhone 5C 16GB 4G LTE White - T-Mobile,,399.0,1,"The only reason I gave it a star at all is because I had to in order to write a review! I ordered this Iphone 5c as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. When we got it the package that it came in was torn up. But since the phone ""SEEMED"" to be in great shape we kept it. My daughter received it on December 25th 2016 and on January 11th 2016 it fell out of her jacket pocket and the screen cracked. So we took it to the iPhone store in our city ( that has been there for many years) to get her screen replaced. Upon trying to remove the screen the man could not get the screen to pop out and I had just watched him do two iPhones before ours so it should have been an extremely easy task but it was not after about 3 to 4 minutes of messing with the screen he finally got one end to pop up then looked at me and asked "" Where in the world did you get this junk at"". When I asked what he meant he turned the phone around and showed me where the phone had already been refurbished and glue was used to put the screen back in with! Upon further inspection it was found that the iPhone 5c that we purchased had an iPhone 5s home button squeeze in there as we continue to look several of the screws that he removed did not even belong in that phone and were so long that they would not even screw all the way down. As we continued we also found that the stickers that go in the inside to let you know if it has been submerged into water were completely gone and non existent. Moving on we found that there was a metal plate just stopped off in the back of the phone that did not even go to an iPhone at all!

"BLU WIN JR - 4.0"" Windows Smartphone - Global GSM Unlocked - Yellow",BLU,59.99,1,"Going to list the problems I had with the phone, in no particular order, to make your decision easier. More info will follow.* Screen - 4"" screen was fine for what I needed, but the phone would have to be held at an angle in landscape for you to be able to see the entire screen. Hurts the eyes because the angle is off. Also makes the front facing camera almost unusable because of this.* CPU/GPU/RAM - Only 512MB RAM. Crashes when using any memory intensive app and when browsing graphic intensive webpages. GIF's do not display correctly.* WiFi - Would turn off by itself and require a restart to turn back off. Got worse over time and even stopped working for awhile. Had to do a hard reset on my phone and it still occasionally turns off by itself. SIM isn't recognized after some reboots, which adds to the headaches and requires more reboots.* Windows Phone OS - Not upgradeable to Windows Phone 10, depressing amount of apps available. Most, if not all, of Microsoft Apps run better on Android and iOS. Goes to show you the lack of developer support for Windows Phone. A lot of the good apps are developed by a 3rd party, which raises security concerns.* Messaging - Cannot view messages or send them. App crashes when trying to open a message.I purchased the phone on April 22, 2015 and I was able to live with all the other problems on the phone except for the messaging app problem, which started happening about a week ago. Have since bought a new phone (Android) and regret ever putting up with this phone for so long.

"SONY XPERIA Z3 D6603 LTE 16GB 5.2"" GSM Unlocked (Black) - International Version No Warranty",,289.95,5,"I have had 3 of these phones over the past couple of years, I'll get to that in a minute...Pros:*Excellent display, bright and clear even in the sunlight. Very good representation of colors and 1080p is crystal clear.*Great audio quality through headphones and the front facing stereo speakers are some of the best quality I've ever heard on a mobile device, period. The only other phone that I've heard that gives these speakers a run for their money is the HTC M8, and even then it's just a difference of opinion on what you like. The speakers were the main selling point for me in buying the Z3.*The fastest phone I've owned, can still keep up with most current flagships by other brands even though it's a 2 year old phone thanks to it's beastly 2.5 GHz quad-core processor and 3 GB of RAM.*It's 3,100 mAH battery is SUPERB, the longest lasting battery I've ever seen at work in a phone, easily outlasting current generation phones making other people jealous 😀. After a full day at work, which includes a few texts here and there, usually about an hour of browsing the web and playing a couple of games while simultaneously playing music at lunch, and then another hour or two of playing nonstop music with the Walkman app after closing down, it's usually only down to around 70% or so from full. That's working outside in the 90 degree+ Florida heat. Standby time is pretty amazing too, fully charged at night and usually still around 95-97% percent 8 hours later.*The camera is, while not the best, still excellent. 20 megapixels is plenty but the pictures don't always come out quite as good as I'd expect or like for being Sony's 2014 flagship. Nonetheless, still a great camera for still pictures... I'd give it a 7 out of 10. Video recording in HD and full HD are excellent, with the option of 60 fps and even has an included app to record slow motion shots at 120 fps. Built in stereo microphones make the experience even better.*3,100 mACONS*The glass back is extremely fingerprint prone...That's really the only complaint I have about this phone.I'm currently on my third Z3... The first one I accidentally ran over with a forklift (I enjoy listening to music when I close at work at night, had the phone sitting on the forklift next to the seat, took a turn too fast, phone fell, I cried for a couple of hours. Surprisingly however, the screen still turned on by using the power button and the volume and camera buttons still worked, the phone even still received calls and texts. Not too bad for being run over by a 10,000 pound piece of machinery. Pretty impressive metal casing Sony put around the phone. The screen was shattered beyond recognition mind you, but that's to be expected. I had the phone a little over a year with NOT one issue. My second Z3 lasted about a month. When it first arrived, the back glass panel was slightly lifted away from the phone's metal casing. Within a couple of weeks it had started coming off with only my case holding it on, I tried electrical tape which held up fine for a couple of weeks until the screen developed a phantom crack (I've read on forums that it's a rare issue with the Z3s) which within about an hour rendered the screen entirely nonfunctional, starting at the top and making it's way down. It was rather depressing to see the phone basically die that quickly 😞.Now I'm on my third one and again upon arrival, the back casing was a little loose. Also the screen is lifted up slightly in the same spot that the back is. But I'm just going to stick with this one and take my chances because I love it so much. The new Z5 seems like a great phone but just not enough of an improvement for me right now to spend that kind of money again. Also from what I've researched, the stereo speakers don't sound quite as good because of the placement and design of the grilles.It's been about three months and so far the phone is still holding up OK, so that's good. I will update if it (God forbid) dies on me or gets worse.Also my second and third Z3s had/have the notorious overheating camera issue, the first one never had the issue. The camera will overheat within a few minutes, which is exponentially accelerated when being used outside in the Florida heat.All in all, I love the Sony Xperia Z3, and while some people criticize their phones, I praise their revolutionary designs and features like the fact that it's extremely water resistant /dust resistant and has an excellent battery, front facing stereo speakers, full hd screen, 20 megapixel 1080p/2K video recorder, very lightweight and slim and sleek design, durable and a very fast phone...One thing to note though from my experience with three of them is if you buy one now, I would not test it's durability or water resistance if you don't have to.

It has the same features except for the color. It has 5.5 inches screen and it has a 5.1 Android Lollipop operating system. It is lightweight and is also thin. It is super easy to use and its response time is also fast. I like this phone because it has a smart wake feature so I don't have to press the power button to wake it up. Just double tap and it will wake the phone up. I also like the fact that it's already unlocked so there is no need to pay to have it unlocked. It means that as soon as you get it, you can use it right away with any sim card of your choice. Aside from that, it is also dual sim so you can use 2 sim cards from different carriers at the same time. That for me is very amazing. You don't always find a phone with dual sim. As far as I know Samsung and Apple do not have it. So if you want to use 2 carriers but only want 1 phone then this smartphone is for you. It has all the basic features that a smartphone has so it's a gem if you ask me. A gem that only costs $77.99.I got this product for free in exchanged for my honest review.",1.0,i fell so in love with the first chsling z i got before that i got another one and this time i got the black color because i got the gold color the first time it has the same features except for the color it has inches screen and it has a android lollipop operating system it is lightweight and is also thin it is super easy to use and its response time is also fast i like this phone because it has a smart wake feature so i don t have to press the power button to wake it up just double tap and it will wake the phone up i also like the fact that it s already unlocked so there is no need to pay to have it unlocked it means that as soon as you get it you can use it right away with any sim card of your choice aside from that it is also dual sim so you can use sim cards from different carriers at the same time that for me is very amazing you don t always find a phone with dual sim as far as i know samsung and apple do not have it so if you want to use carriers but only want phone then this smartphone is for you it has all the basic features that a smartphone has so it s a gem if you ask me a gem that only costs i got this product for free in exchanged for my honest review,fall love chsling z get get time get black color get gold color time feature color inch screen android lollipop operating system lightweight thin super easy use response time fast like phone smart wake feature don t press power button wake double tap wake phone like fact s unlocked need pay unlocked mean soon use right away sim card choice aside dual sim use sim card different carrier time amazing don t find phone dual sim far know samsung apple want use carrier want phone smartphone basic feature smartphone s gem ask gem cost get product free exchange honest review,4,0.71,Overall Experience

Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8 Smartphone w/ Carl-Zeiss Optics Camera - White,,99.99,5,"For starts the phone is solid, and colored all the way through so scratches won't be noticeable at all.It can do 4g and wireless charging and all that stuff.Windows 8 on a phone is really nice. It is very simple to use and highly functional. Also the black and white theme is really my style which is good because the phone has very limited theme options so keep that in mind.Win8 does have some downsides though: The browser and bing search freaking suck. Even if you change your default search to something else the search button still pulls up bing. Seriously stop shoving that down our throats. Luckily there is an app called ""UC Broswer"" and that will greatly improve your internet browsing experience.Other failures include the app market which has very little content right now. I can't even do my banking online with this phone... although perhaps that is my bank's fault for not making the app but plenty of apps are missing from this market. I also didn't see any theme apps or apps to change the tile page itself although there were plenty of tile changing apps.That is the last thing that bugged me was the tile page didn't fit the theme at all and the theme options wouldn't let me change it and no apps existed that would change it. Honestly I would prefer a list version of the tile page instead of blocks. I was able to at least get it in black and white to match the theme though by going into the phone options and turning ""high contrast"" on.This phone is a comfortable weight and size for me and fits well in the hand. Other than my few gripes with the operating system which I managed to work around mostly it is very nice. The hardware is good and the battery life is alright. If you are concerned about battery life it does have power saver mode and you can easily turn off all the power hogs like wifi when the lockscreen is up, location serives, ect. There are a few battery saver apps but honestly the app market is stinky and they probably drain more than the save to manage stuff 24/7.The price on this phone is wonderful for something purchased out of contract too. It is on par with phones that cost several hundred dollars more if you buy them out of contract.I give this phone an 8.5/10",0.0,for starts the phone is solid and colored all the way through so scratches won t be noticeable at all it can do g and wireless charging and all that stuff windows on a phone is really nice it is very simple to use and highly functional also the black and white theme is really my style which is good because the phone has very limited theme options so keep that in mind win does have some downsides though the browser and bing search freaking suck even if you change your default search to something else the search button still pulls up bing seriously stop shoving that down our throats luckily there is an app called uc broswer and that will greatly improve your internet browsing experience other failures include the app market which has very little content right now i can t even do my banking online with this phone although perhaps that is my bank s fault for not making the app but plenty of apps are missing from this market i also didn t see any theme apps or apps to change the tile page itself although there were plenty of tile changing apps that is the last thing that bugged me was the tile page didn t fit the theme at all and the theme options wouldn t let me change it and no apps existed that would change it honestly i would prefer a list version of the tile page instead of blocks i was able to at least get it in black and white to match the theme though by going into the phone options and turning high contrast on this phone is a comfortable weight and size for me and fits well in the hand other than my few gripes with the operating system which i managed to work around mostly it is very nice the hardware is good and the battery life is alright if you are concerned about battery life it does have power saver mode and you can easily turn off all the power hogs like wifi when the lockscreen is up location serives ect there are a few battery saver apps but honestly the app market is stinky and they probably drain more than the save to manage stuff the price on this phone is wonderful for something purchased out of contract too it is on par with phones that cost several hundred dollars more if you buy them out of contract i give this phone an,start phone solid color way scratch win t noticeable g wireless charging stuff window phone nice simple use highly functional black white theme style good phone limited theme option mind win downside browser bing search freaking suck change default search search button pull bing seriously stop shove throat luckily app call uc broswer greatly improve internet browse experience failure include app market little content right t banking online phone bank s fault make app plenty app miss market didn t theme app app change tile page plenty tile change app thing bug tile page didn t fit theme theme option wouldn t let change app exist change honestly prefer list version tile page instead block able black white match theme go phone option turn high contrast phone comfortable weight size fit hand gripe operating system manage work nice hardware good battery life alright concerned battery life power saver mode easily turn power hog like wifi lockscreen location serif ect battery saver app honestly app market stinky probably drain save manage stuff price phone wonderful purchase contract par phone cost dollar buy contract phone,4,0.8,Overall Experience

"BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone - 5.5-Inch Display 4G LTE GSM Unlocked, GREY",BLU,199.95,4,"I have had the BLU VIVO 5R for a month now. I wanted to use it for some time before I penned my review in an attempt to make it as objective as possible.Ok to start off: It is a nice big phone, pretty sleek and with a passable finish. A few people have asked me ""which phone?"", the answer has mostly left them with a ""?"" on their face. So clearly BLU is not a very popular phone in the US market.Personally, I went for BLU coz the specs looked impressive on paper; and I did not want to spend a lot for similar specs from a flagship manufacturer. My honest view is that, its a OK phone, I can't really say i LOVE it, and nor can I say I HATE it. Although, the thought of returning it did cross my mind.Most important difference for any Samsung users, the badge notifications for any new WhatsApp or SMS or missed calls - this feature is absent. As I learnt it after researching, this was a Samsung feature that they apparently copied from Apple. But I have failed to reason why Android does not have this feature built-in. There are a number of skins that claim to enable this functionality, but I was unable to get any of the skins working. I have now just surrendered - and am being forced to getting used to seeing these notifications only in the notifications bar.The auto brightness control/feature while present, is questionable. I have often felt that the default brightness that it auto-adjusts is often lower than ideal required - thus requiring you to manually tweak it often.The camera: while the pictures look better than some of the other models, the pictures don't seem to have the sharp edges when we zoom in. So camera is OK but not really as good as the promise. One serious drawback, the moment you attempt to start the camera app, say when the battery is 15-18%, it just flashes a warning that battery is low and camera cannot be operated and the phone just shuts down! Totally weird! A phone with 3000mah battery switches off at 15% and prevents camera usage!The battery: I use my phone a lot for calls, and then some for whats app and text messages. The battery is good, not great; but will run a day. The only issue however I felt is that it takes forever to charge the battery.Fingerprint sensor: It is nice, and I think this is the only feature that this model had, which I was tempted to go for. Another smart feature is that it give multiple options to unlock the phone. viz. if you are at home, or face recognizition, or few others.Call quality: It is ok, though I noticed I often need to keep the volume to max. Also, weird thing, when I am on call, the phone locks after the usual 30 or 45 secs inactivity, and then when I have to conference or use any other feature. I first need to go to home screen; unlock with my finger and then get back to phone app and then try conferencing. This just adds a 5 - 10 second delay - which irritates me a bit.It has got 3 GB RAM, plus oct core. So speed of operation is not an issue.All in all, its a good buy if your expectations are average+ and you have a tight budget. But if you can live with above shortcomings, its probably a very good phone for you.",6.0,i have had the blu vivo r for a month now i wanted to use it for some time before i penned my review in an attempt to make it as objective as possible ok to start off it is a nice big phone pretty sleek and with a passable finish a few people have asked me which phone the answer has mostly left them with a on their face so clearly blu is not a very popular phone in the us market personally i went for blu coz the specs looked impressive on paper and i did not want to spend a lot for similar specs from a flagship manufacturer my honest view is that its a ok phone i can t really say i love it and nor can i say i hate it although the thought of returning it did cross my mind most important difference for any samsung users the badge notifications for any new whatsapp or sms or missed calls this feature is absent as i learnt it after researching this was a samsung feature that they apparently copied from apple but i have failed to reason why android does not have this feature built in there are a number of skins that claim to enable this functionality but i was unable to get any of the skins working i have now just surrendered and am being forced to getting used to seeing these notifications only in the notifications bar the auto brightness control feature while present is questionable i have often felt that the default brightness that it auto adjusts is often lower than ideal required thus requiring you to manually tweak it often the camera while the pictures look better than some of the other models the pictures don t seem to have the sharp edges when we zoom in so camera is ok but not really as good as the promise one serious drawback the moment you attempt to start the camera app say when the battery is it just flashes a warning that battery is low and camera cannot be operated and the phone just shuts down totally weird a phone with mah battery switches off at and prevents camera usage the battery i use my phone a lot for calls and then some for whats app and text messages the battery is good not great but will run a day the only issue however i felt is that it takes forever to charge the battery fingerprint sensor it is nice and i think this is the only feature that this model had which i was tempted to go for another smart feature is that it give multiple options to unlock the phone viz if you are at home or face recognizition or few others call quality it is ok though i noticed i often need to keep the volume to max also weird thing when i am on call the phone locks after the usual or secs inactivity and then when i have to conference or use any other feature i first need to go to home screen unlock with my finger and then get back to phone app and then try conferencing this just adds a second delay which irritates me a bit it has got gb ram plus oct core so speed of operation is not an issue all in all its a good buy if your expectations are average and you have a tight budget but if you can live with above shortcomings its probably a very good phone for you,blu vivo r month want use time pen review attempt objective possible ok start nice big phone pretty sleek passable finish people ask phone answer leave face clearly blu popular phone market personally go blu coz spec look impressive paper want spend lot similar spec flagship manufacturer honest view ok phone t love hate thought return cross mind important difference samsung user badge notification new whatsapp sms miss call feature absent learn research samsung feature apparently copy apple fail reason android feature build number skin claim enable functionality unable skin work surrender force getting see notification notification bar auto brightness control feature present questionable feel default brightness auto adjust low ideal require require manually tweak camera picture look well model picture don t sharp edge zoom camera ok good promise drawback moment attempt start camera app battery flash warning battery low camera operate phone shut totally weird phone mah battery switch prevent camera usage battery use phone lot call s app text message battery good great run day issue feel take forever charge battery fingerprint sensor nice think feature model tempt smart feature multiple option unlock phone viz home face recognizition quality ok notice need volume max weird thing phone lock usual secs inactivity conference use feature need home screen unlock finger phone app try conference add second delay irritate bit get gb ram plus oct core speed operation issue good buy expectation average tight budget live shortcoming probably good phone,4,0.828,Overall Experience

They would happen at random times and most of the time it was when the phone was just sitting there. Then I kept getting system security error msgs stating ""Unauthorized actions have been detected. Restart your phone to undo any unauthorized changes. At NO point did I attempt to ""root"" or modify this phone's function. I merely installed my apps fom the play store to this phone.

Apple iPhone 5c 8GB Unlocked GSM Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - Green,Apple,159.99,5,"The phone arrived as promised. I really like this phone more than I thought I would. The blue plastic is glossy and smooth like glass to me. And not everyone has an iPhone like this so that is a plus. I am with T mobile. The phone came with a ATT sim car in it. I just switched it out and it was working right away. I speed says Tmobile LTE.The only downside I can see is the screen is not as big as the new Iphone6, as a phone I like this size more. Another thing I wonder is how much longer will Apple support the iPhone 5c. I had to upgrade from a flawless iPhone 4, because that is no longer supported. Which is fine, just that I need a certain app for work, and they only go back as far as the 4s. But I figure the price will make up for that, because by the time it is unsupported, I will be able to get the iPhone 6 at a discounted price.

"I9220(N9000) 5.0"" Capacitive Android 4.0 Dual SIM Smart Phone With 8GB ROM",Star,140.0,3,"This is a beautiful phone. It's like a fake Samsung Galaxy Note (it's actually called, according to the box, ""android note""). I ordered it because I refuse to pay the high $ for the real Galaxy Note or get stuck in another 2-yr contract. Anyway, as I noted, this phone is gorgeous. The problem is, I could not get it to work. It comes with two batteries and an extra battery cover with a plastic case attached to it to shield the screen. The little case is a bit flimsy, but the phone itself is pretty solid and feels good in your hand. I took it out the box, charged it up, popped in my t-mobile sim card and wow, very impressed, it booted right up. An hour later, the screen went black and never came back on. Needless to say, I returned it and got a full refund. My advice, to anyone interested in buying this, after market, phone, chose a seller that use Amazon as his/her shipper and not directly from the seller (which, most of them are in China and outside of the US). That way, if it's an issue, period, Amazon stands behind it. I have heard horror stories. When I ordered it, I received it in about three days. When I had a problem with it, Amazon provided a UPS return label that I was able to print and ship back, free of charge, right away.

Nokia Lumia 635 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8.1 Quad-Core Phone - White,Nokia,99.95,5,"I have read many of the reviews from others about this phone not being unlocked. I ordered one anyway and mine was unlocked. I believe this is a seller issue. Now onto the phone, this is a fairly powerful phone for the price and it has expandable memory which is quite nice. Mine came with AT&T branding and of course their bloatware. The bloatware is easily removed and the phone is working just fine. I also read some reviews that stated the phone wasn't new. Again, I think this is a seller issue, my phone came in mint condition in with a charger in a Nokia 635 box with instruction book. The wrapping over the phone even included the unlock code just in case something should happen and the phone should lock.Pros:Cortana is great, helpful, and funny. She is more robust than Siri and features a more natural sounding speaking voice. She still has some hiccups, but she is very useful. If you are bored, ask her to play the movie game. Need some entertainment? Ask her to sing a song.MS Office integration is a huge plus especially when it comes to revising reports on the go.The Store has some nice apps in it. I shied away from Windows phones for quite some time after being told they didn't have many apps, but I am impressed with the selection offered.Fast phone for the price. This phone won't compete with the latest Galaxy S6 or IPhone, but if you don't need run multiple windows or apps at the same time, then this phone is perfect.Connect with your Microsoft account. You can connect with your Microsoft account and access documents that you have stored in the cloud, very useful if you are trying to work on the go.The battery life on this phone is impressive, but it can vary depending on what apps you are running. Nokia is known for their battery life and this one doesn't disappoint. On a normal day, this phone will last all day and late into the night. This is based on moderate web usage, media streaming, and phone calls.Cons:5MP camera isn't bad, but it lacks a flash. No front facing camera for Skype.The Store, some apps are good, but others are downright ugly. There are a few apps that it seems like developers forgot.Screen seems to scratch easily. I had the phone in my pocket and it managed to get a few minor scratches. They don't affect the display, but they look bad in the light.If you are looking to upgrade to Windows 10 when it comes out, you need to make sure that the phone is running Denim not Cyan as this one does. Depending on your carrier, you can upgrade to Denim immediately upon receiving your phone. Ask your carrier about this or do a quick search online.The Bottom LineIf you are looking for a phone that is like old faithful, then this is for you. If you need the latest and greatest hardware and IOS, then this isn't for you. This phone doesn't offer the customization of an Android, so if you like the idea of playing around with the design, skip this phone. For the price, this phone performs above what I would expect.

HTC One M9 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone w/ 20MP Camera - Amber Gold,HTC,339.99,4,"love the design and style of this phone. bought to upgrade from my galaxy s4. the theme design is fantastic too... I like that I can get themes designed by other people and apply it to the phone. speakers and sound software are also great.The only thing that knocked it down a star for me is the phones reception. Not sure if i got a lemon or not...but it's reception is regularly only 70-80% of what my galaxy 4 had. For those in a 4 bar area, this is probably not an issue...but where my house is at, i can barely scrape 2 bars from my galaxy. it worked with that...but with the M9 i can't even get or take calls.Im currently migration from AT&T to T-mobile, where at least if i can't get good cell reception in my house, I'll be able to use their Voip soluion (AT&T currently only allows iPhones for their VOIP). the fact that i had to switch carriers to use the phone would have dropped more then 1 star, but this is specifically a local issue with me. others may not get the same results.Although I must say, if this is not a lemon, having worse reception then a 4 year old worn out phone is unacceptable IMO. I gave it a pass only because I don't know if it's specific to me, or if it really just has worse reception. Just letting others know...it's not an issue if you get the phone on some kind of plan, but buying upright via Amazon it's buyer beware, so letting folks know.Other then that love the phone...only wish the Tmobile SIM would get here faster :)",0.0,love the design and style of this phone bought to upgrade from my galaxy s the theme design is fantastic too i like that i can get themes designed by other people and apply it to the phone speakers and sound software are also great the only thing that knocked it down a star for me is the phones reception not sure if i got a lemon or not but it s reception is regularly only of what my galaxy had for those in a bar area this is probably not an issue but where my house is at i can barely scrape bars from my galaxy it worked with that but with the m i can t even get or take calls im currently migration from at t to t mobile where at least if i can t get good cell reception in my house i ll be able to use their voip soluion at t currently only allows iphones for their voip the fact that i had to switch carriers to use the phone would have dropped more then star but this is specifically a local issue with me others may not get the same results although i must say if this is not a lemon having worse reception then a year old worn out phone is unacceptable imo i gave it a pass only because i don t know if it s specific to me or if it really just has worse reception just letting others know it s not an issue if you get the phone on some kind of plan but buying upright via amazon it s buyer beware so letting folks know other then that love the phone only wish the tmobile sim would get here faster,love design style phone buy upgrade galaxy s theme design fantastic like theme design people apply phone speaker sound software great thing knock star phone reception sure get lemon s reception regularly galaxy bar area probably issue house barely scrape bar galaxy work m t call m currently migration t t mobile t good cell reception house ll able use voip soluion t currently allow iphone voip fact switch carrier use phone drop star specifically local issue result lemon have bad reception year old wear phone unacceptable imo give pass don t know s specific bad reception let know s issue phone kind plan buy upright amazon s buyer beware let folk know love phone wish tmobile sim fast,4,0.61,Overall Experience

I downloaded this app and I couldn't scroll in my settings menu any longer. Once that happened I couldn't scroll down to reset my phone. I looked all over the internet and finally found a reference to my problem and when you open your settings menu and you can't scroll it after downloading this app what you have to do is swipe two fingers diagonally across the face of your phone. When I first tried this I was swiping across and up and down but by accident I just tried it any old way and when I did it diagonally on the settings page it started scrolling. I thought this might help some of you if you run into this problem. This is the only problem I have had so far. I gave this phone 5 stars because I should have checked ahead of time before downloadingany apps. Also I want to emphasize that this phone S4010u uses a standard size SIM card and not a micro SIM card. I found this out through Consumer Cellular.Update: This phone is really a good working phone. I have had no problems with it except the app mentioned in my first review. This phone does everything that any smartphone is suppose to do. I really like it.Update: October 24.

I have several different Bluetooth headsets some work with this phone some don't.

I read a review that someone posted it said to order a case for a samsung mega 6.3. I did some comparing b4 i ordered and figured out the HARD CASES WILL NOT WORK. I ordered one of the wallet cases For the mega 6.3. This phone will fit in the silicone case attached to the wallet case but the only things that line up correctly is the camera not the flash and the back speaker. So I got creative and took a razor cut the case off of the wallet case and hot glued the case that came with the phone to the wallet case... PERFECT FIT!!

It works fast, camera takes good pics, the blue one is beautiful, and thankfully it had a SD slot.I personally returned mine though because it just didn't want to do things I was used to so going keep using my old Sony Z3 a bit longer. I am a pokemon Go nerd and this phone hates the accessory for the game go plus. I am not sure if the Bluetooth module in the phone just sucks as far as Bluetooth low energy goes or what because it was flawless in my car for music.

This is probably an extraordinarly stupid reason return a phone to most of you but to me I feel like my phone should do what I want.

It could just be my head making it happen but I swear after I returned phone I no longer feel the weird numb sensation.But ultimately I cannot low star a phone for not being made specifically with me in mind.

Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,249.0,4,"I bought this a Christmas gift for my wife, after hearing her disparaging comments about her her 4-year-old smart phone. I'm a Luddite and smart phones are beyond my ken, so I relied on reviews here from those who know these sort of things that the Moto was a good deal. Since the G4 Plus had a 30-day warranty, and her old phone giving her fits, I gave it to her early - good thing. The first phone would not boot up, just a flashing Moto screen. Tried everything in online help, then a chat with Moto. They were helpful and we did all the same things again to no avail, so Moto tech said return it. We did and Amazon was quick with the replacement. The reviews here convinced us our first experience was a fluke, so we stuck with the G4 Plus. Charged it up and it booted right up. The transfer of her data and apps from the old phone was so quick and easy, we didn't realize it had happened. She loves the new phone so far. Her old phone was severely memory limited; she giggles when she sees how much free space she now has. Everything is working perfectly, and the camera takes beautifully clear pictures I thought the price was great for all the features it has. Her new service, Tracfone, has much better coverage in our area than her old Virgin Mobile (I'll not rant about the difficulty obtaining our account number from Virgin so we could transfer her phone number, but it deserves pages.)If it wasn't for the trouble with the first one, we'd make this 5 stars, and we'd really just ding it half star if that was an option.",6.0,i bought this a christmas gift for my wife after hearing her disparaging comments about her her year old smart phone i m a luddite and smart phones are beyond my ken so i relied on reviews here from those who know these sort of things that the moto was a good deal since the g plus had a day warranty and her old phone giving her fits i gave it to her early good thing the first phone would not boot up just a flashing moto screen tried everything in online help then a chat with moto they were helpful and we did all the same things again to no avail so moto tech said return it we did and amazon was quick with the replacement the reviews here convinced us our first experience was a fluke so we stuck with the g plus charged it up and it booted right up the transfer of her data and apps from the old phone was so quick and easy we didn t realize it had happened she loves the new phone so far her old phone was severely memory limited she giggles when she sees how much free space she now has everything is working perfectly and the camera takes beautifully clear pictures i thought the price was great for all the features it has her new service tracfone has much better coverage in our area than her old virgin mobile i ll not rant about the difficulty obtaining our account number from virgin so we could transfer her phone number but it deserves pages if it wasn t for the trouble with the first one we d make this stars and we d really just ding it half star if that was an option,buy christmas gift wife hear disparage comment year old smart phone m luddite smart phone ken rely review know sort thing moto good deal g plus day warranty old phone give fit give early good thing phone boot flash moto screen try online help chat moto helpful thing avail moto tech say return amazon quick replacement review convince experience fluke stick g plus charge boot right transfer datum app old phone quick easy didn t realize happen love new phone far old phone severely memory limited giggle see free space work perfectly camera take beautifully clear picture think price great feature new service tracfone well coverage area old virgin mobile ll rant difficulty obtain account number virgin transfer phone number deserve page wasn t trouble d star d de half star option,4,0.66,Overall Experience

LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone with 5.2-Inch 32GB H790 4G LTE (Carbon Black),LG,399.0,2,"** Second Update **My Nexus 5X crashed out of the blue while I was using it yesterday and wouldn't boot up past the splash screen, even after performing a factory reset. I contacted LG and my only option for repair is to mail it in and then wait for a replacement or repaired phone which will arrive in 7-9 business days, leaving me without a phone for the interim. This is pretty poor customer service in my opinion and I think I'll stick with the two star rating despite the improved performance I mentioned in my first update.** First Update **Eventually I ended up performing a factory reset to try to fix the performance issues, and things seemed to improve. Performance still wasn't great and it would often take 10-15 seconds for the camera to come up, but I wasn't running into the hangs and freezes that I saw before. I would have updated to three stars except for the events that led to my second update.** Original Review **I was so excited when I bought this phone, and I was completely enamored for the first couple of weeks. In a nutshell, I love everything about how the phone presents itself initially - its design and performance are superb for the price and seemed to be exactly what I was looking for - but since then I've found that its performance bogs down and it becomes prey to completely unacceptable hangs and freezes on a very regular basis. The much-vaunted March security update seemed to improve things for another week or so and then it was back to the status quo.The design is excellent - it fits very nicely into my average-sized hands, the buttons are all well placed and easy to use, and the phone looks very nice, although without the ultra premium feel of a true flagship. The fingerprint reader was absolutely transformative for my experience. It is perfectly placed in the center back of the phone where my index finger naturally goes when I hold the phone, so that with very little practice I was automatically unlocking my phone just in the act of pulling it out of my pocket. The camera takes very good pictures - when it gets around to it. Unfortunately, one of the most frustrating things about this phone is that the camera takes at minimum 10-20 seconds to become usable and I often find that it hangs indefinitely when I try to launch the camera until I quit the app and re-launch it. This means that I've pretty much given up on taking pictures of my children unless they're in a mood to sit still for a minute or so (guess how often that is...).Overall, this phone is tragic because it seems exactly like my ideal phone until it starts crashing and freezing. But I am extremely frustrated every single day with this phone and using it these days is like playing russian roulette - I might be able to get directions and traffic updates and listen to an audiobook for my drive home, or I might just be banging my head on the steering wheel while the navigation freezes and the audio cuts out every 5 seconds.

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Space Gray) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,49.0,5,"I bought the iPhone 5s (16GB) in Space Gray from Express Mobile and I was totally skeptical, not because I suspected it was a bad product, but because I always feel hesitant about shopping online, especially if it's a used or refurbished item, but I took the leap of faith.

Moto G Play (4th gen.) - White - 16 GB - Unlocked,,149.0,5,"I really wanted to do a review for this phone, because it does everything my Galaxy S5 did, at a fraction of the cost. Love the phone. It works great with T-Mobile. Verizon had my Galaxy phone rigged so it wouldn't function normally with T-Mobile. This phone was much more compatible. It does everything I want. Hotspot, navigator, sound quality great, blue tooth fine, Screen display is high def, responds well, no problem with video or sound, music works with Bluetooth speakers, battery life great, settings easy to use...does it all. It may not be compatible with T-Mobile Wi-Fi calling- that's the only thing so far I've found so far. It does work just fine with my Wi-Fi though, just not for making phone calls over Wi-Fi. I got a Cover-on belt clip style cover (a little loose fitting, but does the trick) for it and a screen protector. Standard plug for the adapter. It charges slow, but the charge lasts a couple of days. Just plug it in over night. Regarding the ads, they are actually good amazon offers and they are small on the lock screen. They don't get in the way at all and seem to be offers for stuff chosen for me...I actually like them and they are not designed to be easily activated. I have never accidentally selected the ad. Get the phone with the ads - for $50 off, they are absolutely unobtrusive. Great Phone for an amazing price.

"Apple iPhone 5s AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, Silver",Apple,139.95,3,"Granted, this is an older model, but I prefer to hold at least the semblance of a phone next to my ear than a wanna be iPad (iPhone 6 and others). The format was easy to learn: I also use Mac computers. I like the touch screen. Would prefer NOT to have the Apple watch icon, which so far I fail to find how to remove.I don't harbor hoards of pictures, but do use the phone for my Kindle books (300+) and Solfeggio music (lots again) and the 16GB seems to be adequate for my needs. Basically, the phone is more for business than personal. It is my first experience with texting and have to admit, I have become a fan. Quick. To the point. Get 'er done. Important in our no nonsense little time work world.IMPORTANT TO KNOW: my account with AT&T is a monthly No Contract. When I asked about a contract, the sales rep told me because this is considered a ""third party"" phone, I was not eligible for a monthly contract. That requires buying your phone from an AT&T distributor or directly from them. For me this was fine. I got a great deal with more data time than a contract arrangement and my monthly is less than $50.Another Point to Ponder: No one really tells you that with this phone (maybe others?) every month it is best to completely shut it down to reboot. After all, it is a computer. I found this out when I lost capability to enter addresses into my contacts. A friend who had used the i5s alerted me to the reboot feature. Doing this, I have not had any further problems, mechanically.CON: that in a way all Apple products are intrusive into our life by recording and keeping a digital record of EVERYTHING you do on the phone: calls, texts, web sites. I understand Android does the same, but not as intrusive as Apple. I don't like this aspect at all. Be aware.PRODUCT was delivered per my special request on time. Product not exactly as described by seller and no instruction guide included.

Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone,Nokia,59.95,5,"For $100, you get most of the basic features a phone which can cost anywhere from 2-6 times as much has. It's not the ultimate mobile computing experience, so if that's what you're looking for then you need to look elsewhere. Personally, I look for my laptop. Anyway, two major features which smartphones have that this phone lacks are a GPS and office document support. Google SMS directions can substitute for a GPS, if you're in a bind. But if you need office documents you probably shouldn't be looking at this phone.It makes up for this in other ways, though. Its battery life is amazing. With data always on and a constant stream of SMS, it lasted 9 days for me. It's more battery life than I need, actually. That may be the only area where this phone goes above and beyond. And while S40 has terrible support for applications, it is probably the most stable phone OS available, which is good because I find the idea of a phone crashing to be ridiculous. But in practical terms this means the phone is very reliable.What more is there to say? Unlike many ""phones"" these days, it has a real keypad and it assumes that when you dial numbers your plan is to call someone. This phone is not going to make you throw away your digital camera or your computer, which is just fine with me because I don't think a phone can replace those things. On the other hand, this phone has plenty of amenities and it won't hang you out to dry either.",2.0,for you get most of the basic features a phone which can cost anywhere from times as much has it s not the ultimate mobile computing experience so if that s what you re looking for then you need to look elsewhere personally i look for my laptop anyway two major features which smartphones have that this phone lacks are a gps and office document support google sms directions can substitute for a gps if you re in a bind but if you need office documents you probably shouldn t be looking at this phone it makes up for this in other ways though its battery life is amazing with data always on and a constant stream of sms it lasted days for me it s more battery life than i need actually that may be the only area where this phone goes above and beyond and while s has terrible support for applications it is probably the most stable phone os available which is good because i find the idea of a phone crashing to be ridiculous but in practical terms this means the phone is very reliable what more is there to say unlike many phones these days it has a real keypad and it assumes that when you dial numbers your plan is to call someone this phone is not going to make you throw away your digital camera or your computer which is just fine with me because i don t think a phone can replace those things on the other hand this phone has plenty of amenities and it won t hang you out to dry either,basic feature phone cost time s ultimate mobile computing experience s look need look personally look laptop major feature smartphone phone lack gps office document support google sms direction substitute gps bind need office document probably shouldn t look phone make way battery life amazing datum constant stream sms last day s battery life need actually area phone go s terrible support application probably stable phone os available good find idea phone crashing ridiculous practical term mean phone reliable unlike phone day real keypad assume dial number plan phone go throw away digital camera computer fine don t think phone replace thing hand phone plenty amenity win t hang dry,4,0.682,Overall Experience

Nokia 220 RM-971 Unlocked Cell Phone with 2MP Camera (Black),Nokia,174.1,1,"This is a first for me. I have never written a negative review in my life, however this begs to be the exception. First of all, this appears to be a phone aimed primarily at the Caribbean market. The primary language is Spanish on both the box and instructions. There is also an English translation.I did note when researching the phone that there was a video review that noted the back cover was virtually impossible to remove. I have had a number of phones with removable battery covers, but never like this one. After trying a half hour with no success, I decided to return it. I was concerned that further attempts to pry it off would damage it and render it nonreturnable. The device is very small and very cheaply made I have been a Nokia admirer and user for years and I cannot believe this is a product of theirs - or Microsoft.

"Blackberry Z30 Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black",BlackBerry,249.99,1,"I am a fan of the Blackberry OS 10 and own a Z10, which I like very much, except for its completely inadequate battery life. The Z10 battery died during the day after starting the day fully charged once too often and so I ordered a Z30 from Amazon. As luck would have it, I received the phone in time to take to NYC (my wife and I go to the opera 4 or 5 times/year). We had a dinner reservation after the opera and were a little late heading to the restaurant and so I tried to call them to let them know we'd be a bit late. The call connected, but the person who answered could not hear me. Yes, the mute was off (I am a retired computer professional -- 50 years doing OS work and running software projects; I am not a novice). I tried again. Same thing. I ended up making the call with my wife's Android phone. Later at the hotel, I tested the Z30, calling my wife's phone. Same problem. Oddly, I can make voice recordings with the phone, so it's not as simple as a dead mike. It also works correctly on speaker phone. But if you do not set it to ""speaker"", the other end will not hear you, though you do hear a faint echo of what you say through the earpiece. A little Googling reveals that this is a common problem with Z30s, so caveat emptor. Mine is going back tomorrow and I will simply have to put up with the Z10's lousy battery life (I do have a second battery for it, but it is really a pain having to change batteries mid-day and make sure two are charged; despite the excellent software and UI, I think I'm beginning to see why Blackberry is not gaining ground: hardware design problems compounded by sloppy quality assurance).",3.0,i am a fan of the blackberry os and own a z which i like very much except for its completely inadequate battery life the z battery died during the day after starting the day fully charged once too often and so i ordered a z from amazon as luck would have it i received the phone in time to take to nyc my wife and i go to the opera or times year we had a dinner reservation after the opera and were a little late heading to the restaurant and so i tried to call them to let them know we d be a bit late the call connected but the person who answered could not hear me yes the mute was off i am a retired computer professional years doing os work and running software projects i am not a novice i tried again same thing i ended up making the call with my wife s android phone later at the hotel i tested the z calling my wife s phone same problem oddly i can make voice recordings with the phone so it s not as simple as a dead mike it also works correctly on speaker phone but if you do not set it to speaker the other end will not hear you though you do hear a faint echo of what you say through the earpiece a little googling reveals that this is a common problem with z s so caveat emptor mine is going back tomorrow and i will simply have to put up with the z s lousy battery life i do have a second battery for it but it is really a pain having to change batteries mid day and make sure two are charged despite the excellent software and ui i think i m beginning to see why blackberry is not gaining ground hardware design problems compounded by sloppy quality assurance,fan blackberry os z like completely inadequate battery life z battery die day start day fully charge order z amazon luck receive phone time nyc wife opera time year dinner reservation opera little late head restaurant try let know d bit late connect person answer hear yes mute retire computer professional year os work run software project novice try thing end make wife s android phone later hotel test z call wife s phone problem oddly voice recording phone s simple dead mike work correctly speaker phone set speaker end hear hear faint echo earpiece little googling reveal common problem z s caveat emptor go tomorrow simply z s lousy battery life second battery pain have change battery mid day sure charge despite excellent software ui think m begin blackberry gain ground hardware design problem compound sloppy quality assurance,4,0.77,Overall Experience

Nokia Lumia 928 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - White,Nokia,185.0,4,"I bought used here on Amazon. It's a good phone and has a good camera as well. Nokia Windows Phones are great in my experience and with the 8.1 software upgrade (takes a looonnnggg time to update, but it's worth it) the experience is very nice. The screen is great, operation is fast, Nokia includes many very valuable apps and features like a great GPS and good navigation maps and software. Also the FREE Nokia Music is very nice. You can download 4 mixes offline with the FREE version and listen to them even when offline. No ads. Better than many paid apps.The camera has a xenon flash that really works and you can take pretty good pictures for a phone cam. The windows Phone interface, to my surprise, is quite nice, perhaps better than Android overall (as a phone) and this is from a guy with a ton of Android gear. Anyway, it certainly gets the job done and works very well once you learn the ropes. Fast and simple for most everything. And ""Cortana"" the siri-like PA you get with the 8.1 update works pretty well and is a lot of fun. And actually useful. A lot of apps are included and there are plenty more you can load if you wish.The phone features are all pretty standard and work well. This is just a backup for me, so I actually spend most of my time with it as a GPS and music streaming device and phablet. The display is bright and colorful, sound output via the 3.5mm audio (headphones) jack is good. If you can snag one at a good price, I think you'll like it.Update: My device is an AT&T model.

"Apple iPhone 5 Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, White",Apple,265.0,5,"I've had the phone only two weeks now and can already say it is a necessary replacement for my 4S. After watching several YouTube videos, there didn't seem to be much difference between the two other than screen size. However, those videos are when the phone just came out. Recently, my 4S has slowed down - significantly. In comparison, the iPhone 5 runs much smoother and faster.I'm assuming the 4S has slowed down because app developers fixed their apps for the bigger screens and the 4S has to condense the app. My iPhone 4S battery progressively became god-awful as well. To the point where if I am recording a five to fifteen minute video, the charge would be all the way down to fifty percent or below. After a while, my only thought was it is time to upgrade.I could've purchased myself an iPhone 6 or Plus; however, if I want an unlocked phone, at the moment anyway, it's borderline a thousand dollars. My thought process is if I can get a slightly bigger phone with both faster speed and better battery, I could careless what model of phone it is and the iPhone 5 does not disappoint whatsoever.I can now leave the house without a portable charger and record twenty minutes of video without the phone dropping underneath seventy-five percent. I sell online through Amazon and do not have to sit and wait for the Safari page to finally upload after waiting thirty seconds or more. The screen size and thickness does not seem to be much different in other reviews; however, when you feel it in your hand, you know the difference.

Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 16GB Gray-Unlocked International Phone,,116.99,2,"I originally provided this 5-Star review: Exactly as advertised. I was able to purchase a tracfone micro-sim card and the phone works flawlessly. I also upgraded with a 64GB memory card and it works great. This was my original opinionHOWEVER...THEN The 3.5mm headphone jack quit working. The sound was very distorted. I looked on line on how I could fix it and was recommended to use an alcohol wipe with a straightened paperclip to clean the 3.5mm port. I did this an it worked...FOR A SHORT TIME. I thought I had somehow allowed dirt/grime/whatever to get into this jack. But the second time it quit working I was listening to it, Was working fine, then it just went out. Exact same distorted sound issue. I tried cleaning it, with no luck. I have found no way to fix this. Also, there is absolutely no support for an international Samsung phone.A phone without the ability to get sound out of a 3.5mm jack is ALMOST USELESS. Sure, I can use a blue tooth headset for calls and a blue tooth speaker for sound, but that isn't allowed on an airplane. All other functions work, just not the 3.5mm headphone jack. So I am downgrading my previous 5-star to a 2-Star with the warning: DO NOT BUY THE INTERNATIONAL VERSION OF THIS PHONE!",2.0,i originally provided this star review exactly as advertised i was able to purchase a tracfone micro sim card and the phone works flawlessly i also upgraded with a gb memory card and it works great this was my original opinionhowever then the mm headphone jack quit working the sound was very distorted i looked on line on how i could fix it and was recommended to use an alcohol wipe with a straightened paperclip to clean the mm port i did this an it worked for a short time i thought i had somehow allowed dirt grime whatever to get into this jack but the second time it quit working i was listening to it was working fine then it just went out exact same distorted sound issue i tried cleaning it with no luck i have found no way to fix this also there is absolutely no support for an international samsung phone a phone without the ability to get sound out of a mm jack is almost useless sure i can use a blue tooth headset for calls and a blue tooth speaker for sound but that isn t allowed on an airplane all other functions work just not the mm headphone jack so i am downgrading my previous star to a star with the warning do not buy the international version of this phone,originally provide star review exactly advertise able purchase tracfone micro sim card phone work flawlessly upgrade gb memory card work great original opinionhowever mm headphone jack quit work sound distorted look line fix recommend use alcohol wipe straightened paperclip clean mm port work short time think allow dirt grime jack second time quit work listen work fine go exact distorted sound issue try clean luck find way fix absolutely support international samsung phone phone ability sound mm jack useless sure use blue tooth headset call blue tooth speaker sound isn t allow airplane function work mm headphone jack downgrade previous star star warning buy international version phone,0,0.351,Battery & Performance

Good reception.At first, I thought the back slid off to open the battery and sim card section, but the back is actually all one piece (despite the deceptive lines on the back that look like they allow the back to slide off). If you look at the top of the case, you'll see a little slot. I slipped the edge of a coin in there and pried the back off, working my way all around the perimeter of the back with the coin.

He always had those awful brick phones built a million years ago, so he's kinda lost with this new tech phone with lots of menus and apps, LOL.But don't get me wrong, he's totally pleased with this Nokia, it is very fast, has some kick ass camera and it's really entertaining to use it for Internet browsing, watching Youtube videos or playing games, which are the first things my brother did with it.Two major things that worry me a little with this phone are kinda related.The first one is that this is pretty much the only Nokia phone with the MeeGo OS, because Nokia abandoned the project after this one was produced, and then moved on with another OS. So I'm a little worried that Nokia quit supporting this phone or that some apps can't be installed because they're not compatible and I don't know it anyone is producing app versions for MeeGo. As an example, Angry Birds is not available for this one.The other thing is related to MeeGo, too. Whatsapp it NOT available for this phone (and I don't think it will be). Instead, you have to download a non-official version called ""Wazzap"" which uses the official servers, so you can talk with all your friends using the official Whatsapp, but you can't send or receive pictures, sounds, or any kind of content except for the text messages.I'm a frequent user of WhatsApp, and I have at least 10 contacts who I have to communicate with all day, every day, by using WA, so this would be a weak point for me in particular.If you can lookout if your favorite apps are available for MeeGo, or this Nokia N9 in particular, and they are, then this phone is great for you.

I'm glad I bought it via Amazon and was able to return it.I bought the mint version and, within a few weeks, the color on the bottom corners were starting to wear away. The phone also feels very cheap. I'm not opposed to plastic in phones; it's one of the reasons I love the Moto G. The difference is that the Moto G has a metal frame with a plastic backing. The Nexus 5x is pretty much all plastic; it feels too light and creaky. I'm sure this device will die if dropped even once. Beyond the build quality, I also had problems with the touch screen. Calibration felt off as some presses would not be registered at all. Colors looked nice and the display is nice but touch issues are unforgivable. Battery life is average.

The battery, with heavy use it only gives 8 hours? You literally have to charge during the work day and then at night again, not convenient at all, no modern phone, even with heavy use, should have less than a 14 hour battery life. Perhaps a new accessory, a wireless charging case WITH internal battery and a convenient kick stand which extends battery life by 60% or more?2. The navigation touch buttons should never be lit up for long when watching videos or reading, way too bright and distracting3. The browser has no forward button, start page or home button, very inconvenient4. MOST OF ALL, FREE UP MUCH OF THE FILE SYSTEM RESTRICTIONS, if you download something there is no way to find them or get them off the phone, (leave that for evil and crazy iPhone), a file manager preferably with network/workgroup capabilities, it is windows after all.5. Being able to create folders would be nice for organization, convenience and speed6. The NAVIGATION needs a few things, firstly to be a bit more accurate, often it shows a destination as in the middle of the road or in a vacant lot next door, but also a quicker was to search favorites especially when looking for a destination, more and quicker ways to select DRIVE TO when viewing a saved location and to tell us if we will arrive at our destination on the LEFT or on the RIGHT or STRAIGHT AHEAD, how else will we know which lane to be in, do you know how inconvenient that can be on a 4 lane highway?7. A built in way to check minutes and messages used based on free numbers, out of package numbers, reduced rate times and overseas calls8. NO EXTERNAL MEMORY, WHAT? HD video recording (10Gb per hour) and 41mp pics? My music collection alone is 16gb.9. BEING ABLE TO SYNCHRONIZE with a PC desktop software and OUTLOOK via USB, wifi OR/AND bluetooth.10. A quick console for WIFI, BT, DATA, PROFILES, RESTART, BATTERY SAVER, FLASHLIGHT etc.11. A ""breathing light"" option for the sleep state to we know when an alert is waiting.12.

CNPGD All-in-1 Watch Cell Phone & Smart Watch Sync to Android IOS Smart Phone (Gold Plus),CNPGD,59.99,1,"It's not great, but definitely neat. I have an iPhone so Apple isn't exactly cooperative as they have their own products they have spent millions developing. The speaker isn't loud, and the corded headset is awkward and earbuds are hard to use. Phone calls work, but I did have to put the watch up to my ear to hear clearly at one point. The Bluetooth range is short approximately 10 feet. It works great through my phone via Bluetooth for music and talk through other Bluetooth speakers that are also sync to my phone. I got a micro sd card and put music on it, it only plays in file manager. Hooked up to a Bluetooth speaker on its own, it skips and sound quality is poor. It's so bad, I now want to return it. This makes it the worst MP3 player I've ever had, considering the wired headphones are very uncomfortable. I haven't tried to pair it with my newer Toyota yet. I bought this just to see if a smart watch is something I would like. $50 is cheap enough considering what I'm going to be spending on a nice watch. It's helping me figure out what I want. I've already seen a lot better watches on Amazon, w cameras. I paid $38 for this watch, it was too much, and the price went up since I bought it.

Sony Xperia Z5 E6653 3GB/32GB 23MP 5.2-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (GOLD) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony,350.99,5,"Alright so after about a full month of using, I think I'm ready for a review now. First of all let me note that I use a E6683(Dual SIm) and its from Hong Kong. The first thing I will say is YES the LTE does work in the US, be it T-mobile or AT&T actually any GSM carrier will do.Screen• The screen is really sharp even though it's just a 1080p, thanks to it X-reality. However if you were to compare this to a Galaxy S6 or any smartphone with a AMOLED display, I would say the AMOLED does produce more vibrant color. Pixel vise I highly doubt anyone can tell the different unless you hold the very very close to your eyes (which of course, not a lot of people will do that). I do think that reading on the Z5 is more comfortable thoughSound• Sony has a lot of commercial regarding about their ""Hi-res"" music and ""Hi-res"" player and I think they are right. The stereo front speaker is nice since you will rarely block it but don't get your hope on it since its not really that loud. I mean you wouldn't want to use it as an entertain system with a lot of people anyway. Next the headphone, I've seen a lot of review saying the sound quality isn't as good as the other smartphone out there, in this case I will have to take a different ground. I own a Sony MDR-1ADAC and the sound is amazing when pair with the Z5. I tried compare with it Galaxy S6 and to me I feel like there is clearly different quality in music. On the down side, you are require to have a Hi-res music quality otherwise the quality isn't that . . . .Performance• ""SoC 810 does it overheat ?"" my answer is ""It really depend"" If you're recording a 4K video then yes it will definitely heat up but so does the other smartphone. Gaming vice I think the Z5 is doing fantastic, the Z5 can run any game so far that I tried smoothly. It does though lag sometime when it heats up (rarely, like 1% ) and has low battery mode is activate. It definitely run smoother than my HTC oneM9+ haha.• Now everyday uses such as email, texting, web surfing, all of these are buttery smooth. In fact I would say any flagship is the same in this area, unless you came from an IOS which is a lot heck smoother.Camera• That hybrid focus ! Yes it focus really fast BUT it take like a WHILE to processing the image. If you came from a Galaxy S6 or even from an Iphone 5 you will notice a substantial different in time. Iphone took a picture in like a blink of an eye, while S6 is a little slower than that but still in a blink of an eye. But for the Z5 its like 1-2 second on camera processing after picture was taken which can be huge deal if you really need to get that picture. I would say the Z5 is more like a digital camera since it be ""hit"" then done. The image quality though I would say the Z5 is better compare to the S6 or Iphone 6 but its not really a by a big margin though. Also if you really want to take a professional picture, then any smartphone wouldn't do as of now. Overall I wouldn't sacrifice the 1-2 second for a little better camera, but if you can live with that, then I would just say go ahead.• Front camera is okay but wouldn't say it's the best out there in the market compare to like a selfie centred phone. It does produce a satisfy result though.Software• If you like Stock-Android then you will probably like this too. It ran almost identical to stock android except with the small app. There's a bloatware but you can un-install it or just disable it. The finger print scanner on this phone is superb, its super and way more accurate than the Iphone 6 or even the S6 (at least to me).• This is for people who has a PS4 and want it to use for a remote play. It work technically but don't expect the same experience from the TV also a good internet connection is require to a smooth remote play too. Unless you want to connect you Z5 to a Lan cable, which work haha (I did that :D)• The battery on this phone is last longing, you can expect a whole day or more with this phone. The charging is quite slow to me though even with the Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 but maybe I was just used to a tiny battery of an Iphone 6 and S6.Phone• The phone also come with expandable storage which could give you an 32GB boost in less than $50• The water proof and dust proof thingy isn't really a big deal if you're always careful around with your phone• The strap hooker or whatever it call, to me is something I really miss. With this I can use the phone without fear of dropping, I can even take a photo without fear of dropping the phone into a river, jungle, mountain or so whatever you can name it.OverallThe phone is a premium phone if you ask me but does it worth the price, I wouldn't say it worth it to buy this phone as of now. The music quality on this phone is superb if you use a Hi-res audio and headphone. The camera is also really good but take about 1-2 second longer than the IPhone or S6 to process the image. Heating isn't something you have to worry anymore, as per gaming it will eventually heat up after a while of playing but so does every phone. Overall I would say this is a great phone, it would be perfect for me if the camera processing is at least as fast as the S6",17.0,alright so after about a full month of using i think i m ready for a review now first of all let me note that i use a e dual sim and its from hong kong the first thing i will say is yes the lte does work in the us be it t mobile or at t actually any gsm carrier will do

I use to have a Samsung Galaxy Nexus and seriously this one is just as amazing IF NOT BETTER!!!! I'm on a fixed income and use Straight Talk service so I have to buy my phones outright.

Apple iPhone 6 Plus 128GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Cell Phone - Space Gray,,648.0,5,"Bought from Apple Express Electronics and was satisfied with the promptness and courtesy of the seller. Item arrived new and sealed, as advertised! Came with a Verizon sim but hey, I'm glad the iPhone comes with CDMA and GSM antennas, so activating with AT&T was as easy as sticking in the respective sin and going through the usual activation process.The iPhone 6 Plus itself is HUGE, but everyone knows that by now. I do look at it in comparison with other phablets and think that Apple should rethink the top part to make the phone slightly shorter (maybe placing the front camera, the sensor and speaker all in a raw) or maybe rethinking the internal arrangement of parts. Other than size it is a very nice and slick looking device. Yes, some may say, base on the front panel, that it is just an iPhone but blown up. Although true, it is slim enough and the back (although probably inspired by the HTC M8) makes it look like a very premium phone. I personally miss the glass back of the iPhone 4 and 4S but can probably understand that said choice is more prone to cracked phones.I will not go into details on the performance of the phone. You can visit YouTube and just search for the details on that. However, I can say that it provides a very smooth experience going from one page to another, opening and exiting apps and accessing the control center and notification menu. This has to be taking into consideration as it is not as spec heavily as say the Galaxy Note 4 or the Xperia Z3 or many other android phones that have very impressing internals. Yet the iPhone works with what it has and works really good. The camera is still 8MP but the photos and videos are gorgeous. Maybe his is one of few reasons why Apple prides itself on quality and justifies its price tag. ...but I think the phone should be at least $50 cheaper for all models!IOS is simple and works well I a big phone. I wished it had home screen widgets and more customization options other folders but iOS isn't a broke OS. It works fine all around. I like finally being able to rotate my phone on the home screen (although a minor detail to some, it is more than welcomed and I think should be on all iOS devices).

Samsung Galaxy S4 SGH-I337 Unlocked GSM Smartphone w/ 13 MP Camera - Red (No Warranty),Samsung,288.89,5,"This review will be less about the product itself (because we all know this is an amazing, powerful, fast, feature-packed flagship smartphone) and more about SIM Compatibility/Network. Because that's why we're looking at unlocked phones, right?I digress. In June, I bought the Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy SIII from WalMart for $459.99. I thought it an amazing purchase that I would not regret... I was so wrong. Little did I know it was a CDMA phone (locked to Straight Talk) and it ran on the SPRINT network. This meant little to me then, but it means the world to me now, because I now know that Sprint is the most awful, bogged-down, spotty, insert-derogatory-phrase-here network on this entire planet. I live in Hawaii, and Sprint's network in Hawaii is an absolute joke. I had no service at my own house OR my workplace that was right on the convergence line of two Sprint towers (Sprint can't switch towers very easily so just went into roaming). The closest Sprint tower to my house had a coverage radius of roughly 1 mile, and still does. And worst of all, it's a 3G-only network. Not a regular 3G network, either. I got EDGE speeds at best. I've never pulled more than 1Mbps on the up or down. Straight Talk's S3 was also very watered down, with a locked bootloader and very limited software accessibility. It was a sad life for me.I had had it. I was done with this pitiful excuse for a carrier. All my friends had either AT&T or Verizon, who both had full LTE buildouts here. They always pulled webpages and videos like lightning. Their coverage was broad and consistent. I figured it was time to pinch a few pennies. I had heard that Straight Talk had released an LTE-capable AT&T SIM Card, and I needed a phone for it to power. I had my heart pretty much set on the S4, but didn't know which one to get.This was the one.The product arrived brand-new and completely unopened. Shiny new S4. I put it in the wall, popped the SIM in, edited the APN settings ([...]) and BAM. The 4G LTE icon popped up in the status bar, as well as two consistent bars of service. My experience thus far has been wonderful - I've been pulling a pretty steady 15up/19down everywhere I've been thus far. I now have coverage in my home. I have yet to see the NO SERVICE icon. This may not be a problem for many of you as you may be already coming from AT&T's network - but it's a whole different world for me.TL;DR? This phone works perfectly with Straight Talk's AT&T Micro SIM card. There is no hassle and no fuss - I set it up entirely online in 10 minutes. If these qualifications meet your criteria, buy this sucker - you won't be disappointed.",111.0,this review will be less about the product itself because we all know this is an amazing powerful fast feature packed flagship smartphone and more about sim compatibility network because that s why we re looking at unlocked phones right i digress in june i bought the straight talk samsung galaxy siii from walmart for i thought it an amazing purchase that i would not regret i was so wrong little did i know it was a cdma phone locked to straight talk and it ran on the sprint network this meant little to me then but it means the world to me now because i now know that sprint is the most awful bogged down spotty insert derogatory phrase here network on this entire planet i live in hawaii and sprint s network in hawaii is an absolute joke i had no service at my own house or my workplace that was right on the convergence line of two sprint towers sprint can t switch towers very easily so just went into roaming the closest sprint tower to my house had a coverage radius of roughly mile and still does and worst of all it s a g only network not a regular g network either i got edge speeds at best i ve never pulled more than mbps on the up or down straight talk s s was also very watered down with a locked bootloader and very limited software accessibility it was a sad life for me i had had it i was done with this pitiful excuse for a carrier all my friends had either at t or verizon who both had full lte buildouts here they always pulled webpages and videos like lightning their coverage was broad and consistent i figured it was time to pinch a few pennies i had heard that straight talk had released an lte capable at t sim card and i needed a phone for it to power i had my heart pretty much set on the s but didn t know which one to get this was the one the product arrived brand new and completely unopened shiny new s i put it in the wall popped the sim in edited the apn settings and bam the g lte icon popped up in the status bar as well as two consistent bars of service my experience thus far has been wonderful i ve been pulling a pretty steady up down everywhere i ve been thus far i now have coverage in my home i have yet to see the no service icon this may not be a problem for many of you as you may be already coming from at t s network but it s a whole different world for me tl dr this phone works perfectly with straight talk s at t micro sim card there is no hassle and no fuss i set it up entirely online in minutes if these qualifications meet your criteria buy this sucker you won t be disappointed,review product know amazing powerful fast feature pack flagship smartphone sim compatibility network s look unlocked phone right digress june buy straight talk samsung galaxy siii walmart think amazing purchase regret wrong little know cdma phone lock straight talk run sprint network mean little mean world know sprint awful bogge spotty insert derogatory phrase network entire planet live hawaii sprint s network hawaii absolute joke service house workplace right convergence line sprint tower sprint t switch tower easily go roam close sprint tower house coverage radius roughly mile bad s g network regular g network get edge speed good ve pull mbps straight talk s s water locked bootloader limited software accessibility sad life pitiful excuse carrier friend t verizon lte buildout pull webpage video like lightne coverage broad consistent figure time pinch penny hear straight talk release lte capable t sim card need phone power heart pretty set s didn t know product arrive brand new completely unopened shiny new s wall pop sim edit apn setting bam g lte icon pop status bar consistent bar service experience far wonderful ve pull pretty steady ve far coverage home service icon problem come t s network s different world tl dr phone work perfectly straight talk s t micro sim card hassle fuss set entirely online minute qualification meet criterion buy sucker win t disappoint,0,0.359,Battery & Performance

Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910T 32GB 4G LTE T-Mobile GSM Unlocked Smartphone White (Certified Refurbished),Samsung,289.0,1,"Okay. .. it took 4 phones to get one that's decent enough to keep. .. I would understand some of these things If they were used but they are supposed to be actually refurbished and I can guarantee you that these ""certified refurbished"" are not refurbished at all. ...Phone #1 : perfect in every way except the camera lens was so scratched you couldn't even take a picture I mean badly scratched just looking at the back of the phone you notice the damage easily so it was clearly not refurbished with such an obvious flaw. Seriously refurbished but they don't even test the camera?Phone #2 : Had a bad crackling speaker, damaged stylus and the water damage sticker was showing it had been wet at some point so if it was refurbished they would have put a new water damage sticker on right? Shouldn't matter is just a sticker right? But the fact I got 4 of them and know they aren't refurbished combined with the crackling speaker I'm pretty sure it really was water damaged. Plus the stylus didn't work. ... refurbishing and you don't even test the stylus hmmmmm....Phone #3 : Was not even the correct model number. .. the phone is advertised as a N910t however they sent me a N910t3 which still a note 4, is a different variant and takes different software than the regular n910t. One of the reasons I wanted the phone is because I can put android 4.4 back on it. (It's still my favorite) the t3 variant they sent me already been updated to 6.0 and couldn't go back to 4.4. The regular n910t that's advertised you can load whatever you want on it but not the t3 they sent me. ... also this stylus didn't work right either bummer.Phone #4 : It works and I'm keeping it but the sp02 oxygen saturation sensor doesn't work but not refurbished or it would all work. ......I'm just not sending it back again I'll deal with the broken sp02 sensor. ...Conclusion : not one of the 4 phones ordered had android 4.4 as it's advertised. They either had 5.1 or 6.0. If you get the one advertised the n910t you can roll back to whatever one you want but you can't go back with the n910t3. None of these phones were actually refurbished and with so many things to go wrong your really rolling the dice. .. gps, pulse, sp02, infrared, accelerometers, etc etc etc stylus etc etc there are so many things that can go wrong 2 cameras just so many things that can go wrong you buy a refurbished or new to avoid these problems but there's too many things to go wrong and these are not really refurbished .

I've been playing with it a bit and so far I'm really pleased with it. We've hooked it up to the WalMart Family Mobile plan, which uses T-Mobile, so it appears to be truly unlocked, in case there was any concern there. It uses Android 4.0.4 right out of the box, because I didn't update anything. The screen is nice and fluid, and it's got more bells and whistles than I know what to do with. I think he'll be really pleased. I'd love to keep it for myself, and may end up buying another.The only, and I mean only, thing I didn't care for is the wall charger. It appears to be for European use, which is fine, because it comes with an adapter for a US plug, but that adapter is terrible. It doesn't fit snugly to either the wall outlet or the charger itself, which means it really won't charge the phone unless you hold it in place. Of course, it charges from a computer with no problem, but if you're in the US then you'll probably want to buy a different travel charger for it. Also, the little instruction book with mine is in French. Which I guess means it really is an international phone, so that's a good thing.Oh, one other thing: if you're looking for an Otterbox for it, the Commuter series seem readily available, but the Defender series are more difficult to find.

I ordered this Samsung S6 from Amazon because I wanted white and couldn't find it in any stores. I specifically wanted the S6 because it's the lightest weight, lighter than the S7 and the iPhone 6S. The phone is nice looking and stylish, and I love the pearl white color, but I'm a bit confused that the back of my phone only says Samsung, but does not display 'S6' like the other Samsung S6's that are sold here in America. The writing on the back is in another language, not English, so maybe it's made different in other countries? I have noticed the battery drains faster than my last Samsung S3 mini that I had for 3 years, and I have had the phone freeze up on me a couple of times and the screen turned black and locked up. I called Samsung customer service and they told me how to reset by pressing the down volume button and the button on the right side of the phone both at the same time for 20-30 seconds. I'm hoping that doesn't happen very often and has me a bit nervous. I'm past the time frame where I can return the phone now, so I hope I won't have any major issues since I paid $450.00, and would like to have it for at least 2-3 more years.

LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - Mint 32GB (U.S. Warranty),LG,578.0,5,"This is a great Android smartphone and Amazon (I purchased mine through the Warehouse for extra savings) has the best deal on them. The price is even better than what buying the Nexus 5X direct from Google is--unless you are buying one through Google's Project Fi, Google MVNO phone service.One of the best things about the Nexus line is that they run pure, vanilla Android. This is the Android OS devoid of the clutter of overlays, like Samsung's TouchWiz, that take up space on the device and tend to make it run slower. It's also a major reason why phones like Samsung always take longer to receive software updates and the latest operating systems. The Nexus line being not linked to a carrier (which also slows down your updates) allows you to switch between different SIMs with ease. Google provides the latest OS for two years (I just got my Android Nougat upgrade a couple weeks ago), access to beta software (if you're into that), support for three years, and zero carrier bloatware (you would not believe how much space this has freed up).This phone handles light gaming well. I am not a heavy gamer so I do not know if it would stutter for that. The camera is quite good and I have captured some very good pictures. Sound quality during calling is great on the phone using Verizon. Having a phone not from Verizon can enable you to use Verizon Prepaid which is much cheaper than Verizon's postpaid plans. You can also check out Google's Project Fi (which I can't wait to try) as the Nexus 5X is one of three Nexus phones that can run on it. My battery lasts about 2 days or so. The USB-C is much quicker charging (although take note this phone cannot wirelessly be charged) than standard micro USB. The screen is pleasant to use in a variety of lighting.Some of the downsides is that this phone does not have expandable storage. So no SD card. However, this is not a big deal for someone like me. All my photos get uploaded to Google Photos right away where I had unlimited storage for photos on Google Drive for free. I never notice that my phone only has 16GB (there's also a 32GB version). This phone does have a noticeable camera bump that prevents the phone from laying flat. However, getting a phone case (like the Candy Shell Grip like I have) solves this problem. Like most plastic backed phones, the Nexus 5X is a bit slippery, especially for people with very small hands like me, again a grippy case solved this problem. This is a smaller phone (5.2 inch screen)--which for me is a plus. If you want a larger, phablet check out the Nexus 6P.Overall, I love the Nexus 5X. The price on Amazon was pretty good. It also came with a free 3 months of Google Music which includes You Tube Red, which I really like.",2.0,this is a great android smartphone and amazon i purchased mine through the warehouse for extra savings has the best deal on them the price is even better than what buying the nexus x direct from google is unless you are buying one through google s project fi google mvno phone service one of the best things about the nexus line is that they run pure vanilla android this is the android os devoid of the clutter of overlays like samsung s touchwiz that take up space on the device and tend to make it run slower it s also a major reason why phones like samsung always take longer to receive software updates and the latest operating systems the nexus line being not linked to a carrier which also slows down your updates allows you to switch between different sims with ease google provides the latest os for two years i just got my android nougat upgrade a couple weeks ago access to beta software if you re into that support for three years and zero carrier bloatware you would not believe how much space this has freed up this phone handles light gaming well i am not a heavy gamer so i do not know if it would stutter for that the camera is quite good and i have captured some very good pictures sound quality during calling is great on the phone using verizon having a phone not from verizon can enable you to use verizon prepaid which is much cheaper than verizon s postpaid plans you can also check out google s project fi which i can t wait to try as the nexus x is one of three nexus phones that can run on it my battery lasts about days or so the usb c is much quicker charging although take note this phone cannot wirelessly be charged than standard micro usb the screen is pleasant to use in a variety of lighting some of the downsides is that this phone does not have expandable storage so no sd card however this is not a big deal for someone like me all my photos get uploaded to google photos right away where i had unlimited storage for photos on google drive for free i never notice that my phone only has gb there s also a gb version this phone does have a noticeable camera bump that prevents the phone from laying flat however getting a phone case like the candy shell grip like i have solves this problem like most plastic backed phones the nexus x is a bit slippery especially for people with very small hands like me again a grippy case solved this problem this is a smaller phone inch screen which for me is a plus if you want a larger phablet check out the nexus p overall i love the nexus x the price on amazon was pretty good it also came with a free months of google music which includes you tube red which i really like,great android smartphone amazon purchase warehouse extra saving good deal price well buy nexus x direct google buy google s project fi google mvno phone service good thing nexus line run pure vanilla android android os devoid clutter overlay like samsung s touchwiz space device tend run slow s major reason phone like samsung long receive software update late operating system nexus line link carrier slow update allow switch different sim ease google provide late os year get android nougat upgrade couple week ago access beta software support year zero carrier bloatware believe space free phone handle light gaming heavy gamer know stutter camera good capture good picture sound quality call great phone verizon have phone verizon enable use verizon prepaid cheap verizon s postpaid plan check google s project fi t wait try nexus x nexus phone run battery last day usb c quick charge note phone wirelessly charge standard micro usb screen pleasant use variety light downside phone expandable storage sd card big deal like photo uploaded google photo right away unlimited storage photo google drive free notice phone gb s gb version phone noticeable camera bump prevent phone lay flat get phone case like candy shell grip like solve problem like plastic back phone nexus x bit slippery especially people small hand like grippy case solve problem small phone inch screen plus want large phablet check nexus p overall love nexus x price amazon pretty good come free month google music include tube red like,4,0.777,Overall Experience

Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,249.0,2,"There is a lot to like about this phone. The display is great, the UI is fairly stock Android with little of the bloat and ugliness that other manufactures add. However, every day I had multiple cases of ""ghost touch"" where the phone would start responding to touches and drags and swipes that weren't happening. In some cases the phone was just sitting next to me and apps started coming up, moving around, etc. While this is most-known for happening while on the charger, it also happened to me multiple times when it wasn't charging.Motorola/Lenovo said 4 months ago that it can be fixed with software but to get this software fix, you have to send/take it to a service center. However, reading the thread (hundreds of posts) shows that many of them come back from service centers unfixed. There are reports of service centers keeping a phone for months to get parts even though the company says all it needs is a software fix.And four months after the SW fix has been claimed, new phones still have the issue, there is no OTA update etc. Questions such as when phones with the fix in place can be expected at retailers have gone unanswered. They also declined to estimate what the chance was of getting a second phone with the same problem if you exchanged one. So I decided to return this copy and monitor their forum to see when/if this gets resolved. I guess I was ""lucky"" that it happened immediately because some people had their phones for well beyond their return periods before it started.

"LG KP500 Cookie Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Digital Media Player--International Version (Black), No-Warranty",LG Electronics MobileComm USA,79.0,3,"I, like many others who have written a review, chose this phone because it is very cheap for a touch screen. The first thing I like about the phone is that it is really, really, really light weight. It has a good solid feel to the palm and won't suffer that much cosmetic damage. The phone came with a screen protector so that was nice. I didn't want to spend more than a $100 dollars because all I do is text and call people. With that said, if you do not use internet or don't have a data plan, then this is an okay phone. If you do use a data plan, don't even think about buying this phone, it only uses the Edge network and not 3G. The phone came with a pre-installed firmware version 'KP500AT-V10F'. This firmware is pretty damn slow, so I had to flash the phone to the V10G_00 version. All the tutorials can be found on forums or youtube, just search it. With the new firmware, the texting is 10x better and overall speed in navigating through folders is much better as well. SO UPDATE THE FIRMWARE IF YOU GET THIS PHONE! In addition, a huge con is the amount of confirmation popups whenever you change something. For instance, trying to delete your text messages would follow this order: 'Delete selected?' ----> 'Deleting..."" ----> 'Deleted'. That is really annoying and unnecessary. The call quality is pretty good, and it's bluetooth ready. The camera is okay when there is a lot of light, if there is no light, the image quality is similar to the 'sepia' effect, yeah, its that bad. Overall, I am satisfied with this phone due to the call quality and price, but the biggest cons are definitely the initial firmware, the processing speed, and lackluster camera quality. As for music, it is loud, but who really uses their phone for an mp3 player. The phone also holds 500 total texts, 250 in inbox and outbox, more or less. All in all, if you don't want to be frustrated with the phone's speed, then update the firmware right when you get it.ALSO: THIS PHONE IS ABLE TO SEND AND RECEIVE MMS, DO NOT LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS! YOU HAVE TO CREATE NEW CONNECTION SETTINGS: INTERNET SETTINGS, MULTIMEDIA MSG CENTER SETTINGS, AND A NEW ACCESS POINT.

Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8 Smartphone w/ Carl-Zeiss Optics Camera - White,,99.99,1,"This Nokia Lumia seems like it should be a really FANTASTIC smartphone. But it is not.I have a couple of minor issues and one major one. This phone cannot attach photos and cannot receive attachments. Seriously! The sound quality is terrible. Those are minor issues. Nokia has a TON of Lumia smartphones - that is a minor issue that I will come back toThe big issue - the big problem and the big negative of this phone is the user interface. It seems like it should do everything, but it does not. Microsoft wants windows to act the same way across all devices, and that SOUNDS like a great idea. It might work on a tablet or laptop or pc, or even a server. It does not work here. The interface gets in the way of taking photos. Photos end up dark, out of focus, color-mixed, and worthless. The interface gets in the way of making calls - hanging up, switching between calls without intervention and generally frustrating to no end. The interface gets in the way of sending texts - texts!?!?! Almost anything you might want to do with this high quality device will be a combination of ""How in the world does MS want me to do this?""Cell providers are no help (I tried this phone with Tmobile and with AT&T). Why not? Well, it is a Nokia Lumia 920, but Nokia has a 1020, a 1520, a 520, a 530, a 710, a 521, and about a thousand similar devices. Each of them must have their own unique quarks and quibbles, because on a combined basis, they are beyond the intelligence of the technical support of the cell provider.After paying about $500 for this, it now sits on a shelf. It takes poor photos, makes poor calls, doesn't attach and frustrates. Life is too short to deal with junk like this. I've replaced it with a Samsung galaxy s4 - which at this point I'd give 4 1/2 stars to.I do NOT recommend the Nokia Lumia 920 to anyone.

LG Google Nexus 5 D820 Black 32GB GSM Unlocked (Certified Refurbished),LG,179.99,5,I bought this one to replace my crashed nexus 5 16 g. It arrived as promised. Looks like new. The price is unbelievable. No paper work comes with it so if you are not familiar with this phone you might have to web surf for instructions. Came with an LG charger. I have read a lot of the reviews about this refurbished nexus 5 and some people had some received a bad product. But I have had this one for about a week now and no problems so far.

I am happy to report that I actually received the International version (RM-994) and not the Chinese version. This phone actually connected to T-Mobile and my Internet account without issue. I have been using the phone for several hours now without the unusual heating up that happened with the original purchase. I'll update this if anything crazy happens, but so far I am a happy camper. Warning for other interested buyers, make sure you get the correct version!Original:Within the first two days I've had this phone, I've encountered a few problems. First, the phone I received is not the ""International version"" and is instead the Chinese version (RM-994 vs RM-996). This seems to remove LTE and 4G capabilities. For unknown reasons, the phone became HOT when I was trying to figure out how to set up my network. It would also shut off randomly. A factory reset fixed that issue, but seeing as how it's a Chinese phone, it rebooted back in Chinese. I had to figure out how to get it back to English while also trying to get it past the factory reset instructions. After that, I still could not get it to access the network even after I went through troubleshooting with a tech for hours. During the last attempt, the phone stopped charging. I tried to wiggle the cord, remove it and reinsert it, and plugged other phones and tablets into the charger (which all charged). After that, I decided to be done. I know this phone has great capabilities, but the one I received was a lemon.

Apple iPhone 6s 64GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone w/12MP Camera - Silver (Certified Refurbished),Apple,499.99,5," I recently decided to finally enter the 21st century and get a smartphone. My first choice was an Android phone that was slow and not user friendly at all. Meanwhile, I visited two friends who each had iPhones and were getting along famously. I knew what I needed to do.I picked up this refurbished one from BREED. It's in perfect condition! It came with only the charging cord which was expected and I'm fine with that. I did make the mistake of neglecting to get a nano SIM card. See, I'm home all the time and I only wanted to use it for various apps like for a fitbit, and texting while at home, plus the pictures and video features. I got my own free phone number through Google Play and can text through Hangouts, all without a plan. So I didn't think I'd need a SIM.I learned quickly that a SIM is needed to get to the home screen on an iPhone. So make sure you do that! I picked up a T-Mobile card that had no contract. I popped it in and I was good to go.This works beautifully! I feel so spoiled now, especially after using an inferior phone. I highly recommend picking one up from BREED especially.

Can't comment on the durability yet, having only had the phone for a few days now. So far, I am very impressed. The first thing that came to mind when I got the phone was, the people who commented negatively about this phone, were they talking about the same phone I got?????? To me, this phone can stack up to many of the ""name brand"" expensive phones on the market today. I did have to restart the phone after connecting it to the computer to sync some music and connect with desktop software, because the camera failed to load: But once I restarted, everything was back to normal.

If you want real protection, like an Otterbox, it definitely won't work. I use an SGM dual layer case, which is thinner than an Otterbox Defender, but it still won't work. Basically, the only cases that work with it are those that are so thin as to offer no real protection and are for decoration only, so if you are considering this product, know that you have to choose between protection and convenience. Another problem I have with it is that the blue LED is too bright. I was hoping to use it by my bedside because it sounds very convenient, but blue light is the absolute worst to have around while trying to sleep, and though it's not so noticeable on the office desk, it is quite bright in a dark room and I found it disruptive. I don't think they should have used an LED on it at all, any more than they should put one on a normal wall charger. When it's in use, your phone displays the charging icon, so the bright LED on the charger is totally unnecessary and just for show.

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"I just wanted a basic phone, and this is it. Don't expect Internet access, Facebook, etc, with this thing.My friends mostly have phones costing 2-4 times this much per month (I use the $25/month 750 minute plan). But their phones don't work in buildings, elevators, on the subway, etc., and mine does. It seems that Net10 rents working wireless access from expensive companies and then sells it to us.I have purchased 3 of these phones. One was defective enough to return it, and a second one refuses to go into autolock mode, so I often find it browsing the net or writing its own text messages. To my knowledge it has never actually butt-dialed anyone. I can lock it by just holding down the spacebar, but I often forget. It has never managed to use up my minutes, anyway.A fourth Net10 phone also died before I started with these Samsungs. So why do I give them 5 stars? Because they are practically giving these phones away, and the per month charge is reasonable by US standards.The only reason I don't get yet another phone and dump my slightly defective one is that I'll have to type in about 300 digits to reprogram the new phone to take over my account.As far as usability, the phone is great. The keyboard is fine, even though the keys are tiny and I can barely see them without glasses, it is miles better than my previous 'cheap' phones, which cost much more than these. The menus are well organized, and I use the phone as my daily alarm as well. I like the ringtones selection.",2.0,i just wanted a basic phone and this is it don t expect internet access facebook etc with this thing my friends mostly have phones costing times this much per month i use the month minute plan but their phones don t work in buildings elevators on the subway etc and mine does it seems that net rents working wireless access from expensive companies and then sells it to us i have purchased of these phones one was defective enough to return it and a second one refuses to go into autolock mode so i often find it browsing the net or writing its own text messages to my knowledge it has never actually butt dialed anyone i can lock it by just holding down the spacebar but i often forget it has never managed to use up my minutes anyway a fourth net phone also died before i started with these samsungs so why do i give them stars because they are practically giving these phones away and the per month charge is reasonable by us standards the only reason i don t get yet another phone and dump my slightly defective one is that i ll have to type in about digits to reprogram the new phone to take over my account as far as usability the phone is great the keyboard is fine even though the keys are tiny and i can barely see them without glasses it is miles better than my previous cheap phones which cost much more than these the menus are well organized and i use the phone as my daily alarm as well i like the ringtones selection,want basic phone don t expect internet access facebook etc thing friend phone cost time month use month minute plan phone don t work building elevator subway etc net rent work wireless access expensive company sell purchase phone defective return second refuse autolock mode find browse net write text message knowledge actually butt dial lock hold spacebar forget manage use minute fourth net phone die start samsung star practically give phone away month charge reasonable standard reason don t phone dump slightly defective ll type digit reprogram new phone account far usability phone great keyboard fine key tiny barely glass mile well previous cheap phone cost menu organized use phone daily alarm like ringtone selection,4,0.726,Overall Experience

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 64GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty,,449.99,3,"After going through 3x LG G-series phones in as many years due to lousy build quality (bad touchscreen, screen detachment, bad motherboard/boot loop issues), I decided to abandon the brand. As a consumer, I prize build quality, durability, intuitive controls, and bang for your buck. To put things in perspective, my favorite all-time smartphone design is the Motorola Defy: it was built like a tank and worked underwater; it was rugged--you could drop it and it would barely scratch (no need for a phone case); had minimal bloat-wear; and served perfectly as an Every Day Carry (EDC) workhorse. Unfortunately, due to the current marketing strategy for cell phones, phones like the Defy are unicorns: the market currently is littered with disposable consumer goods built to be glass houses so manufacturers can increase profit. This led to a frustrating search high and low for a mid-tier phone that had good reviews with a decent camera; good build quality; impressive specs for the money; and a solid User Interface (UI) experience. That is, until I came across Huawei, and the Honor 8.Professional and amateur reviews I found were nearly universally positive, pointing to a beautiful body design; good customer support; good camera; good specs, and compatibility with T-Mobile’s 12 band (a lot of other Chinese-made, and international-version phones don’t support 12 band). I started leaning towards purchasing an Honor 8 (U.S. Warranty), but the one thing that held me back were the divisive “love it or leave it” attitudes towards Huawei’s EMUI. Then, I heard they would be replacing EMUI 4.1 in the near future, and Amazon featured a deep discount on Black Friday for the phone (selling it under $300), so I pulled the trigger and made the purchase. I’m about 2 weeks into using this phone, and while I want to love my Honor 8 as much as I did my Defy, Huawei's EMUI 4.1 greatly reduces my enjoyment and experience. This is why I deducted two stars, as EMUI is non-intuitive, and can be extremely frustrating when you miss notifications because of EMUI settings. If and when Huawei updates EMUI away from 4.1, I will give an updated review.Pros:+The phone is relatively slim, and great for one-handed operation.+The phone is fast. The screen unlocks as soon as you touch the fingerprint sensor, and I haven’t experienced lag on any apps.+Battery life is really good. I can go through my commute and work day without having to charge my phone.+The camera is decent quality (minor lag at times when it’s trying to focus), and has friendly controls. I’ve been spoiled by LG’s cameras, but I feel the Honor 8 performs well.+Beautiful external design, but slippery. Definitely get a case for this phone if you don’t want it sliding around.+Vibrant display, and transition times between dark/brightly lit rooms is good.+The phone will turn on WiFi to connect to a known network when you’re in an area you frequent.Cons:-EMUI 4.1! EMUI 4.1!! EMUI 4.1!!!-Initial setup when switching from an old phone to the Honor 8 takes an extremely long time compared to stock Android. This is because EMUI has a bunch of settings you need to micromanage, ranging from app permissions, to notifications, to battery use. What I miss about LG is whenever I upgraded a phone, I’d just connect the two phones via NFC and everything would sync up.-Settings continued: rather than having everything default to being enabled, you have to manually enable some settings. This means if you’re not careful, some of your social media apps and email apps might not be protected by the Battery Manager. This means they won’t run when your phone is off, and you won’t get notifications. This was extremely frustrating on multiple occasions, especially when people were trying to contact me on messenger apps.-No app drawer. It took me a while to figure out how to add an app icon.-Speaker is loud enough, but sound quality is poor and really tinny. This can make listening to some voices (especially high-pitched ones) really annoying. Good luck if you like listening to music, too.-No accessories besides a quick charger. It would be nice if the Honor 8 came with headphones, or an additional USB C-cable.-Other non-intuitive UI: When you slide down for Notifications, the Shortcuts (WiFi, Bluetooth, Flashlight, etc.) section needs to be clicked to access said menu. It’d be better to just have both Notifications and shortcuts combined on the same screen, like with stock Android.-I’m unaware of any profile options: for example, if I want to turn off vibrate and reduce my notification/media/call sounds in the office, I have to play with the volume buttons each time, instead of clicking on a Profiles shortcut to select Home/Work/Outdoors.-Volume and Power (restart/shut down) options can only be accessed with the physical buttons. It would help with UI if we can just slide down to the Notification/Shortcuts menu and be able to digitally manipulate the settings. This would also reduce wear and tear on the physical keys, and let users continue to use the phone if the physical keys break.**If the options I’ve mentioned above are available with EMUI, it just goes to show how unintuitive the UI is. There’s a lot to be desired in terms of intuitive controls, and I really hope Huawei will update EMUI as soon as possible.Final thoughts: The Honor 8 is a great phone that suffers from bad UI design. If EMUI were designed as beautifully as the Honor 8 phone itself, or were replaced with stock Android, I would not hesitate to recommend this phone to friends and family. As it stands, however, I can only recommend this phone for people who are intermediate to advance users, who either enjoy micromanaging their settings, or are comfortable with doing so. Given the Honor 8’s current EMUI, I would not recommend this phone as a gift for someone new to smartphones (parents, grandparents, etc.). I'm not happy to give such an average review, because the Honor 8 has great specs, price, and looks. It's just the UI that suffers. If Huawei improves the Honor 8’s user experience, they will have a complete package with no rivals at this price point. So best wishes to Huawei, and I look forward to be given a chance to provide an updated, higher-rated review in the near future!",1.0,after going through x lg g series phones in as many years due to

BLU Dash JR 4.0 K Smartphone - Unlocked - Silver,BLU,125.0,1,"There's no way around it, this phone is BAD. The cheap price is appealing, especially for a brand new device, but trust me. Don't do it. It's horribly slow in every aspect, there is nothing good about it except the price. But for a mere $20 or $25 more, you can get SO much more. Let me break it down:SCREEN: It's horrible. Viewing angles are terrible and colors only look real if viewed straight on. The slightest angle renders everything like a photo negative.NETWORK: This thing is 2G EDGE only. I knew that going into it, and could deal with it. But trust me: it's insanely slow. It's only good for things involving text. Any picture or image and it grinds to a total halt.RAM: This phone has a laughably pathetic amount of RAM, so little that it can only handle ONE thing at a time. Listening to music and an email comes in? The music will stop because handling an email and music is too much for this phone. And EVERY time you press the home button, you have to wait several seconds while the entire home screen reloads.STORAGE: This phone only has room for maybe 3 or 4 apps before it is full. You simply cannot use this without an SD card, don't even try. Even with an SD card, you will run out of space very very quickly. This is not the phone for someone who likes to try new apps.Every app you try to open takes several seconds and often crashes.Every app you try to open will kill any other stuff running in the background, including streaming music, Pebble, Android Wear, etc.Lots and lots of apps are not compatible with this phone including Dunkin Donuts, Target, etc. Many more claim they are compatible but then crash immediately on launch.In short, this is a bad phone that I wouldn't wish on anyone. Maybe it would be okay for someone who is on WiFi all the time and only does one thing at a time. Perhaps a grandparent who only wants Facebook and literally nothing else.I do not recommend this phone for anybody. Please, save your money, spend just a little bit more and get something better. The Blu Advance 4.0 is only $25 more and is far superior, for example.",7.0,there s no way around it this phone is bad the cheap price is appealing especially for a brand new device but trust me don t do it it s horribly slow in every aspect there is nothing good about it except the price but for a mere or more you can get so much more let me break it down screen it s horrible viewing angles are terrible and colors only look real if viewed straight on the slightest angle renders everything like a photo negative network this thing is g edge only i knew that going into it and could deal with it but trust me it s insanely slow it s only good for things involving text any picture or image and it grinds to a total halt ram this phone has a laughably pathetic amount of ram so little that it can only handle one thing at a time listening to music and an email comes in the music will stop because handling an email and music is too much for this phone and every time you press the home button you have to wait several seconds while the entire home screen reloads storage this phone only has room for maybe or apps before it is full you simply cannot use this without an sd card don t even try even with an sd card you will run out of space very very quickly this is not the phone for someone who likes to try new apps every app you try to open takes several seconds and often crashes every app you try to open will kill any other stuff running in the background including streaming music pebble android wear etc lots and lots of apps are not compatible with this phone including dunkin donuts target etc many more claim they are compatible but then crash immediately on launch in short this is a bad phone that i wouldn t wish on anyone maybe it would be okay for someone who is on wifi all the time and only does one thing at a time perhaps a grandparent who only wants facebook and literally nothing else i do not recommend this phone for anybody please save your money spend just a little bit more and get something better the blu advance is only more and is far superior for example,s way phone bad cheap price appeal especially brand new device trust don t s horribly slow aspect good price mere let break screen s horrible viewing angle terrible color look real view straight slight angle render like photo negative network thing g edge know go deal trust s insanely slow s good thing involve text picture image grind total halt ram phone laughably pathetic ram little handle thing time listen music email come music stop handle email music phone time press home button wait second entire home screen reload storage phone room maybe app simply use sd card don t try sd card run space quickly phone like try new app app try open take second crash app try open kill stuff run background include stream music pebble android wear etc lot lot app compatible phone include dunkin donut target etc claim compatible crash immediately launch short bad phone wouldn t wish maybe okay wifi time thing time grandparent want facebook literally recommend phone anybody save money spend little bit well blu advance far superior example,4,0.717,Overall Experience

"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Black (U.S. Warranty)",Asus,235.16,5,"Haters of this phone simply don't know what they are buying. If that is you, I suggest sticking to iPhone or other flagships crafted for the unwashed masses. I will address some of the main criticisms I have seen so far.""The screen is not very good""This phone has an IPS screen, meaning it will be similar to a computer screen. In my opinion that makes it a lot easier on the eyes than an AMOLED or ""Retina"" panel when it comes to reading text, which is what I am most often doing. With a matte screen protector and the ability to easily go into reading mode, I find the experience enjoyable. No phone is easy to read in full sun. If that's what you need, maybe try a kindle or an actual book.""Not as fast as flagships""This is a $300 unlocked phone. Per AnTuTu and Geekbench benchmarking, this phone is as fast or faster than the Galaxy S5, which is $400 unlocked. If you want the Galaxy S6 or iPhone 6 unlocked you are looking at $600-$900 for a device that is as easy, if not easier, to drop into the toilet. With 4gb of RAM and an Intel chip, this is a multitasking beast. I believe with further updates this phone has the ability to be even faster.https://youtu.be/eISQpwmRr4E""Too heavy""This is a 5.5"" device. With a large battery and 4gb RAM (more than current flagships) I find the weight perfectly fine at 9.6oz. If this is a problem for you, maybe trying hitting the gym once in a while.""Camera not as good""Again, this is a $300 device. If you are serious about photography, get a real camera instead of a camera phone. I haven't had any problems with this camera so far. I like it better than the Galaxy S4 camera that I have been using.The biggest issue I have had so far is having the capacitive home button so close to the space bar when using the keyboard. This could be easily fixed with a software update, by making the spacebar taller or separated a little from the home button. I use a 3rd party keyboard anyways so I anticipate a quick fix for this issue.This device actually feels better in my hand than a Galaxy or an iPhone. The curved back is a more ergonomic than a flat back.

BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - Global GSM - White,BLU,125.99,4,"Initial report after only a few days; it's ok for the low price, don't spend more than $100 for it.First the negatives; 1. when you dial on the dial pad, there is slight pausing if you dial real fast, you don't have to press each number more than once though, it still catches up with the dialing. I thought this is rather odd for a phone with an Octacore processor, considering my old phones don't pause when dialing the numbers, they can keep up. Perhaps a software update could fix it? I tried adding different dialers, it did not help, it is a slight delay but it doesn't really affect the function of the phone. 2. Big chin on bottom of phone with no buttons=wasted space and makes it bigger than it should be (which you can already see that and it's in other reviews so I knew that before buying it). 3. Notification volume is paired with ringer volume, you cannot adjust the volume of notification separately. I tried downloading various volume apps it did not work, still the same. 4. Still no Lollipop Update! This is Feb. 20th 2016 and still no Lollipop update! It was supposed to be released back in August 2015! I actually don't like Lollipop, so that is alright with me :), but I would download it if it was avilable, I would back up my phone first, and then update it to Lollipop.Good things:Reception is good (although it show less bars, I looked in settings/about/sim where it shows the reception and it is strong), in other words Blu fixed the fact that their phones were showing a stronger signal than they really had IMHO, now it is more accurate.Ringtone/external speaker is loud enough so far (I have not tried speakerphone yet), I was listening to youtube and it is loud enough.Voice talking sounds good; I made a call to another phone and left a voicemail and it was very clear, sounded really natural I was surprised.Fast processor! It can run games pretty good, so far I have been playing a few games like temple run, bejeweled and it rain them fine.Nice screen, pretty good.Battery life is good; having screen on for any reason will cause it to drain (like any phone with a big screen), when not in use and in standby battery doesn't use anything even after a long time.Sound recorder works fine (voice notes)Nice package; came with a matching yellow rubber/silicon case, white charger, headphones, manual, screen protectorOther: I run ZenUi Launcher which is pretty sweet :)Be careful using sim card adaptor, when removing your sim the contacts can get damaged if it is not smooth and flush when removing the card.

LG Optimus G E970 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - Black,LG,449.0,1,"Avoid the AT&T version of this phone! The AT&T LG Optimus G comes with pre-installed AT&T apps that are absolutely terrible. Like mind-blowingly, unbelievably, spectacularly, I-can't-believe-they-shipped-this awful.This would just be a minor annoyance except for the fact that the AT&T Address Book app pops up unexpectedly in the foreground during the common, everyday scenario of viewing your contacts list--and this misbehaving app cannot be disabled or uninstalled without rooting your phone (note: this ""perma-fail"" situation is specific to the LG Optimus G--more recent phones with this pre-installed app/malware allow you to disable AT&T Address Book). To repeat: EVERYT time you go to the Contacts page in the Phone app, after your contacts instantly appear, the phone quickly whisks you away into the completely useless AT&T Address Book (which takes roughly 1 minute to load). If you dismiss or force-close the app, it will just pop up the next time. You can't disable or uninstall the app from Settings or various popular ""cleaner"" apps. Unlike newer models, you can't disable the app from popping up via the secret ""*#*#2666#*#*"". This app will annoy you until the end of time (or until you give up and just root your phone).Hilariously, the most bizarre part is that AT&T Address Book doesn't even work! If you try to set up the redundant syncing of contacts to some AT&T cloud service, the app just closes. I'm truly shocked that this product ever saw the light of day.As a quick aside to AT&T: this piece of software is not a ""value add."" This is taking an already solid, functional system, and bolting on a useless and frustrating distraction. Please put down the mouse and stop ruining Android. Thanks!In summary: save yourself a ton of trouble and buy a non-AT&T phone (or at least a newer model than this one where you can avoid this headache entirely).",0.0,avoid the at t version of this phone the at t lg optimus g comes with pre installed at t apps that are absolutely terrible like mind blowingly unbelievably spectacularly i can t believe they shipped this awful this would just be a minor annoyance except for the fact that the at t address book app pops up unexpectedly in the foreground during the common everyday scenario of viewing your contacts list and this misbehaving app cannot be disabled or uninstalled without rooting your phone note this perma fail situation is specific to the lg optimus g more recent phones with this pre installed app malware allow you to disable at t address book to repeat everyt time you go to the contacts page in the phone app after your contacts instantly appear the phone quickly whisks you away into the completely useless at t address book which takes roughly minute to load if you dismiss or force close the app it will just pop up the next time you can t disable or uninstall the app from settings or various popular cleaner apps unlike newer models you can t disable the app from popping up via the secret this app will annoy you until the end of time or until you give up and just root your phone hilariously the most bizarre part is that at t address book doesn t even work if you try to set up the redundant syncing of contacts to some at t cloud service the app just closes i m truly shocked that this product ever saw the light of day as a quick aside to at t this piece of software is not a value add this is taking an already solid functional system and bolting on a useless and frustrating distraction please put down the mouse and stop ruining android thanks in summary save yourself a ton of trouble and buy a non at t phone or at least a newer model than this one where you can avoid this headache entirely,avoid t version phone t lg optimus g come pre instal t app absolutely terrible like mind blowingly unbelievably spectacularly t believe ship awful minor annoyance fact t address book app pop unexpectedly foreground common everyday scenario view contact list misbehaving app disabled uninstalled root phone note perma fail situation specific lg optimus g recent phone pre instal app malware allow disable t address book repeat everyt time contact page phone app contact instantly appear phone quickly whisk away completely useless t address book take roughly minute load dismiss force close app pop time t disable uninstall app setting popular clean app unlike new model t disable app pop secret app annoy end time root phone hilariously bizarre t address book doesn t work try set redundant syncing contact t cloud service app close m truly shocked product see light day quick aside t piece software value add take solid functional system bolt useless frustrating distraction mouse stop ruin android thank summary save ton trouble buy non t phone new model avoid headache entirely,4,0.622,Overall Experience
LG Electronics G3 Stylus D690 Dual SIM - Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging (Black Titanium),LG,162.5,5,"I bought this LG G3 Stylus for my SO. I specifically chose the G3 Stylus option for him because he has manly hands/fingers (obviously). Sometimes he gets what I call the ""fatfingeritis"" where he goes to type something and ends up hitting a million keys at once. The stylus is perfect for someone like him. It is very sleek and tucks away into it's built-in hole, very well. He doesn't feel awkward holding it and feels it has a good circumference for him to handle.The phone itself is beautifully crafted. LG did a great job design-wise. The volume up and down buttons on the back allow for excellent ease of use. We like that they're separated by the power button as well. The buttons can be customized to operate other functions of the phone, such as the camera. If you do not wish to have that option, it is easily able to be switched off. I personally loved that when the camera is up, I can simply push the volume down button to take a selfie, for instance. There isn't that awkward messing around trying to get situate your thumb to push the button while attempting to get the right angle. Ladies, you know what I'm saying, right?! Not that my SO really cares about that option! HahaAnother thing my SO really liked was the slight curve of the phone. He felt really comfortable carrying the phone around without a case because he felt it fit perfectly with how his hand naturally holds the phone. With his job, however, we did buy him a case/holster combo. That review is posted as well. It is an amazing case!The specs on this phone are pretty awesome as well.The screen is 5.5 inches, which is pretty decent size in this day in age. My SO likes the larger screen because it makes for easier reading and less squinting. The rear camera is a nice 13MP. It is not the highest of phones out there but is decent for what he uses it for. This is a 3G capable phone and has an OS of 4.4.2 preinstalled out of the box.

I ordered this Iphone 5c as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. When we got it the package that it came in was torn up. But since the phone ""SEEMED"" to be in great shape we kept it. My daughter received it on December 25th 2016 and on January 11th 2016 it fell out of her jacket pocket and the screen cracked. So we took it to the iPhone store in our city ( that has been there for many years) to get her screen replaced. Upon trying to remove the screen the man could not get the screen to pop out and I had just watched him do two iPhones before ours so it should have been an extremely easy task but it was not after about 3 to 4 minutes of messing with the screen he finally got one end to pop up then looked at me and asked "" Where in the world did you get this junk at"". When I asked what he meant he turned the phone around and showed me where the phone had already been refurbished and glue was used to put the screen back in with! Upon further inspection it was found that the iPhone 5c that we purchased had an iPhone 5s home button squeeze in there as we continue to look several of the screws that he removed did not even belong in that phone and were so long that they would not even screw all the way down. As we continued we also found that the stickers that go in the inside to let you know if it has been submerged into water were completely gone and non existent. Moving on we found that there was a metal plate just stopped off in the back of the phone that did not even go to an iPhone at all! The gentleman proceeded to open up another iPhone 5c identical to ours that had also been refurbished just so he could show what a horrible device we had bought! I will never buy from this company again and I will absolutely make sure that this information gets put up on every single blog that I run!

Of course, they won't let you uninstall any of it, but you can disable most of it. So you have to spend an hour or two disabling the 30 plus apps that you do not need or want. Then the phone works pretty good after that, and you have a little room to install some apps that you actually want, but not a whole bunch. If you install too many apps, the phone goes back to being sluggish again and gets to the point where it is barley usable.

BLU Tank II T193 Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ Camera and 1900 mAh Big Battery - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Black Red,BLU,20.99,4,"This is a decent dumbphone, and has some noted improvements from the previous model, but also a few problems. EDITED: Worse battery life than previous model - reached two battery bars a couple days earlier than the original tank did. It feels slightly more flimsy IMO, this might have to do with the sharper corners (I find rounder corners do better when dropping the phone and don't get caught on things). The two things I absolutely hate about this phone are how difficult it is to remove the battery cover, and the strange way the sim slots are set up.The sim slots are near the top of the battery compartment, and are actually stacked on top of each other (like a shelf). The 1st sim sits in a flimsy-feeling metal ""drawer"" on the bottom shelf; the drawer itself can be pulled out by a small metal tab/knob. The 2nd sim card is much easier to insert, as it just sits on the top shelf. Anyhow - it is almost impossible to get the battery cover off and pull out the sim ""drawer"" without fingernails, a major con since I bought this for a male friend who has short nails... Pro/con list comparing this model to the previous model:Pros:UI ImprovementsBrighter Flashlight (or ""Torch"" as they call it)3.5mm headphone jackLarger ScreenMicro usb charger rather than mini usb charger (you can use your android phone cables, yay!)D-pad is way easier to useCons:Worse battery lifeFlimsier & sharper corners than previous phoneLarger phone overall (mostly in height)Hard to remove the coverHarder to remove the batteryHard to remove the sim from slot 1, could potentially see the sim 1 ""drawer"" getting stuck/bent and not working at all with prolonged use# keys have a bit less tactile feel to them",57.0,this is a decent dumbphone and has some noted improvements from the previous model but also a few problems edited worse battery life than previous model reached two battery bars a couple days earlier than the original tank did it feels slightly more flimsy imo this might have to do with the sharper corners i find rounder corners do better when dropping the phone and don t get caught on things the two things i absolutely hate about this phone are how difficult it is to remove the battery cover and the strange way the sim slots are set up the sim slots are near the top of the battery compartment and are actually stacked on top of each other like a shelf the st sim sits in a flimsy feeling metal drawer on the bottom shelf the drawer itself can be pulled out by a small metal tab knob the nd sim card is much easier to insert as it just sits on the top shelf anyhow it is almost impossible to get the battery cover off and pull out the sim drawer without fingernails a major con since i bought this for a male friend who has short nails pro con list comparing this model to the previous model pros ui improvementsbrighter flashlight or torch as they call it mm headphone jacklarger screenmicro usb charger rather than mini usb charger you can use your android phone cables yay d pad is way easier to usecons worse battery lifeflimsier sharper corners than previous phonelarger phone overall mostly in height hard to remove the coverharder to remove the batteryhard to remove the sim from slot could potentially see the sim drawer getting stuck bent and not working at all with prolonged use keys have a bit less tactile feel to them,decent dumbphone note improvement previous model problem edit bad battery life previous model reach battery bar couple day early original tank feel slightly flimsy imo sharp corner find rounder corner well drop phone don t catch thing thing absolutely hate phone difficult remove battery cover strange way sim slot set sim slot near battery compartment actually stack like shelf st sim sit flimsy feeling metal drawer shelf drawer pull small metal tab knob nd sim card easy insert sit shelf impossible battery cover pull sim drawer fingernail major con buy male friend short nail pro con list compare model previous model pro ui improvementsbrighter flashlight torch mm headphone jacklarger screenmicro usb charger mini usb charger use android phone cable yay d pad way easy usecons bad battery lifeflimsi sharp corner previous phonelarger phone overall height hard remove coverharder remove batteryhard remove sim slot potentially sim drawer getting stick bent work prolonged use key bit tactile feel,4,0.731,Overall Experience

"Motorola XT890 RAZR i Unlocked Android Smartphone with 8MP Camera, Wi-Fi, GPS, 4.3-Inch Screen, 2 GHz Processor, 8 GB Memory and MicroSD Slot - No Warranty - Black",Motorola,144.99,5,"I recently upgraded to the Motorola XT890 RAZR after going through three Blackberry phones in five years. I have had this new phone for two weeks now and it has absolutely surpassed my expectations in every aspect.This phone is the international unlocked version of the current Motorola RAZR M, which is only carried by Verizon in the US. However, the Razr i works with GSM carriers (i.e. T-mobile and AT&T). Works with micro-SIM card. With T-mobile in the US, it runs on 3G when not on WiFi. Not sure about 4G yet, but definitely not 4G LTE compatible per Motorola specifications. I was a bit skeptical to purchase such an expensive unlocked product online and not really knowing for sure if it would have glitches or function properly in the US, but I'm so glad I took the risk.A few highlights/reviews on various features:CALLS: crystal clear reception on both ends and great speaker phone, even on the road. The rings tones are nice and pleasant.TEXTING: SWYPE feature may be enabled and disabled, but available. In any texting mode, very responsive keyboard. Even for the user who is not accustomed to a touch screen, it is super easy as the keys ""pop"" out on the screen and eliminate ""fat finger"" syndrome.CAMERA: HD-quality (back facing) and decent quality for (front facing - i.e. self portraits). Impressive and clear shots, and I dare say close to my brother's LG Optimus G, which has the highest photo quality on the market currently at 13MP. The video quality is pretty nice too. The camera feature is also well done in that it has its own ""quick access"" button on the lower right edge, so you don't have to ""dig"" to find it. Really nice for those spontaneous, unexpected photos ops, which of course always happen when one is not ready!QUALITY/BUILD: Corning Gorilla glass touch screen. Looks and feels durable.Does not feel flimsy by any means. Probably could get away without a case/back cover, but probably not a bad idea to have a screen protector to reduce smudges and fingerprints.FEEL: one of the few ""one-handed"" devices out there. Nice and thin, probably more comparable to the iPhone 4, in terms of overall size.APPS: Does not come with an overwhelming number of Apps, which is nice because you can build up your Apps list and customize from scratch.ALARMS: It has as many options as you need, which is nice for varying workdays and weekends. Also, overall pleasant alarm sounds, which is nice. (But that is coming from the Blackberry, so my perception is skewed and anything really sounds better having said that.)BATTERY LIFE: Fairly decent. This was very important to me, personally, and not many IT reviews focused too much on this so I'll go into more detail for those interested. Today, for example, I spoke on the phone for 1.5 hours total, played Pandora for about 2 hours, sent and received about 15 texts (some days up to 30-40), read about 10 emails, replied to 3 emails, and checked FB about three times...and the battery life is now about 40% left in the 12 hours of usage. You can always install an Android ""App Killer"" that terminates various Apps periodically that run in the background to optimize your battery life. Also, the product comes with a US wall plug, which the USB cord plugs into; that's nice since you can also go between wall or your laptop/PC to charge. Also, the phone is sent with a UK plug/adapter as well (also USB compatible), so that's handy for a trip abroad.In conclusion, if you're looking for a durable, high-quality, practical phone, and you're disappointed because GSM providers here in the US don't carry the Motorola Razr devices, then this is the perfect workaround solution! I absolutely adore this phone, best choice for me. Thanks for reading, hope this helps a bit.UPDATE: August 18, 2013Still very pleased with this phone! I installed Dropbox the other day, and used it to edit some documents in QuickOffice. Amazing! Just very responsive and fast! I haven't found a flaw with it yet, and I've used it for two months now.",20.0,i recently upgraded to the motorola xt razr after going through three blackberry phones in five years i have had this new

compatible per motorola specifications i was a bit skeptical to purchase such an expensive unlocked product online and not really knowing for sure if it would have glitches or function properly in the us but i m so glad i took the risk a few highlights reviews on various features calls crystal clear reception on both ends and great speaker phone even on the road the rings tones are nice and pleasant texting swype feature may be enabled and disabled but available in any texting mode very responsive keyboard even for the user who is not accustomed to a touch screen it is super easy as the keys pop out on the screen and eliminate fat finger syndrome camera hd quality back facing and decent quality for front facing i e self portraits impressive and clear shots and i dare say close to my brother s lg optimus g which has the highest photo quality on the market currently at mp the video quality is pretty nice too the camera feature is also well done in that it has its own quick access button on the lower right edge so you don t have to dig to find it really nice for those spontaneous unexpected photos ops which of course always happen when one is not ready quality build corning gorilla glass touch screen looks and feels durable does not feel flimsy by any means probably could get away without a case back cover but probably not a bad idea to have a screen protector to reduce smudges and fingerprints feel one of the few one handed devices out there nice and thin probably more comparable to the iphone in terms of overall size apps does not come with an overwhelming number of apps which is nice because you can build up your apps list and customize from scratch alarms it has as many options as you need which is nice for varying workdays and weekends also overall pleasant alarm sounds which is nice but that is coming from the blackberry so my perception is skewed and anything really sounds better having said that battery life fairly decent this was very important to me personally and not many it reviews focused too much on this so i ll go into more detail for those interested today for example i spoke on the phone for hours total played pandora for about hours sent and received about texts some days up to read about emails replied to emails and checked fb about three times and the battery life is now about left in the hours of usage you can always install an android app killer that terminates various apps periodically that run in the background to optimize your battery life also the product comes with a us wall plug which the usb cord plugs into that s nice since you can also go between wall or your laptop pc to charge also the phone is sent with a uk plug adapter as well also usb compatible so that s handy for a trip abroad in conclusion if you re looking for a durable high quality practical phone and you re disappointed because gsm providers here in the us don t carry the motorola razr devices then this is the perfect workaround solution i absolutely adore this phone best choice for me thanks for reading hope this helps a bit update august still very pleased with this phone i installed dropbox the other day and used it to edit some documents in quickoffice amazing just very responsive and fast i haven t found a flaw with it yet and i ve used it for two months now,recently upgrade motorola xt razr go blackberry phone year new phone week absolutely surpass expectation aspect phone international unlocked version current motorola razr m carry verizon razr work gsm carrier e t mobile t work micro sim card t mobile run g wifi

"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (White)",Nokia,99.95,1,"i had shopped around and around. i was too ignorant, and settled on this junk drawer of a phone. i had a nokia brick as my first phone so had a false sense of quality from it. phone constantly shuts off apps because memory is full - phone is too slow to support it's own built in apps. WACKfeatures i wanted...#1 - description made the gps look awesome! in fact it SUCKS. takes way too long to locate and is WAY off almost every time. basically useless, because when you are lost you need to know exactly where you are, fast. when i saw how ios or android serve gps i felt very ripped off.#2 - camera quality is much like any 5mp. a lot of phones (and cameras) have these heavy megapixel ratings to trick stupid people like me. we assume more indicates more performance. how did i fall for that again? the flash is ugly as hell, makes color horrid. the first thing i noticed using it was how if i don't like a picture, hit delete, get an error message that memory is full, close apps and yadda yadda... you have to kind of wait and be tricky with it to get it to work... sigh. i need to be able to delete quick at work so i don't have a bunch of extra pics to go through. camera functionality blows. video is ok but needs super bright light to work at all, so not any better than a childs toy camera or crappy webcam.#3 - wifi? yeh i knew wireless G was going to be slow, but combined with this crap browser and buggy phone i felt like i was dialing up to AOL. except that back with AOL i would actually use webpages, with this thing i never could, especially my work website. i got burned pretty bad there, should have had lower expectations.#4 - touchscreen functionality was slow, bugged out, ugly animations (should i say lack of animations). i found myself repeatedly tapping or pressing harder, as a person is prone to do when the crap simply don't work right. i installed a small stack of games on it, all ugly 2d versions of real games. LAME#5 - slide out keyboard? hurt my fingers when pushing upper keys as other reviewers have said. oh and by the way 2 months after warranty expired the screen started to bug out while sliding - i researched to find that is now COMMON among these phones and LAUGHED HEARTILY watching a youtube guide on how to ""fix"" it (cost of parts and tools + time involved means i won't).#6 - FM radio, i basically used two maybe three times. not sure why i thought that would be cool. bluetooth, slow - never ended up using it. software? a joke obviously, digital poison for your pc. the thing has a headphone jack but since the battery is so crappy i never even put any music on it. all these little extra features seemed cool until i found real life usage was a huge pain. - in conclusion, i foolishly defended this phone and convinced myself that despite it's bugs and quirks that i had somehow gotten the best deal i could afford. now i already need to replace it with another $200 phone, plus the $30 backup i had to get just so i could at least get calls till then... i failed at buying a good phone apparently.",0.0,i had shopped around and around i was too ignorant and settled on this junk drawer of a phone i had a nokia brick as my first phone so had a false sense of quality from it phone constantly shuts off apps because memory is full phone is too slow to support it s own built in apps wackfeatures i wanted description made the gps look awesome in fact it sucks takes way too long to locate and is way off almost every time basically useless because when you are lost you need to know exactly where you are fast when i saw how ios or android serve gps i felt very ripped off camera quality is much like any mp a lot of phones and cameras have these heavy megapixel ratings to trick stupid people like me we assume more indicates more performance how did i fall for that again the flash is ugly as hell makes color horrid the first thing i noticed using it was how if i don t like a picture hit delete get an error message that memory is full close apps and yadda yadda you have to kind of wait and be tricky with it to get it to work sigh i need to be able to delete quick at work so i don t have a bunch of extra pics to go through camera functionality blows video is ok but needs super bright light to work at all so not any better than a childs toy camera or crappy webcam wifi yeh i knew wireless g was going to be slow but combined with this crap browser and buggy phone i felt like i was dialing up to aol except that back with aol i would actually use webpages with this thing i never could especially my work website i got burned pretty bad there should have had lower expectations touchscreen functionality was slow bugged out ugly animations should i say lack of animations i found myself repeatedly tapping or pressing harder as a person is prone to do when the crap simply don t work right i installed a small stack of games on it all ugly d versions of real games lame slide out keyboard hurt my fingers when pushing upper keys as other reviewers have said oh and by the way months after warranty expired the screen started to bug out while sliding i researched to find that is now common among these phones and laughed heartily watching a youtube guide on how to fix it cost of parts and tools time involved means i won t fm radio i basically used two maybe three times not sure why i thought that would be cool bluetooth slow never ended up using it software a joke obviously digital poison for your pc the thing has a headphone jack but since the battery is so crappy i never even put any music on it all these little extra features seemed cool until i found real life usage was a huge pain in conclusion i foolishly defended this phone and convinced myself that despite it s bugs and quirks that i had somehow gotten the best deal i could afford now i already need to replace it with another phone plus the backup i had to get just so i could at least get calls till then i failed at buying a good phone apparently,shop ignorant settle junk drawer phone nokia brick phone false sense quality phone constantly shut app memory phone slow support s build app wackfeature want description gps look awesome fact suck take way long locate way time basically useless lose need know exactly fast see io android serve gps felt rip camera quality like mp lot phone camera heavy megapixel rating trick stupid people like assume indicate performance fall flash ugly hell make color horrid thing notice don t like picture hit delete error message memory close app yadda yadda kind wait tricky work sigh need able delete quick work don t bunch extra pic camera functionality blow video ok need super bright light work well child toy camera crappy webcam wifi yeh know wireless g go slow combine crap browser buggy phone feel like dial aol aol actually use webpage thing especially work website get burn pretty bad low expectation touchscreen functionality slow bug ugly animation lack animation find repeatedly tap press hard person prone crap simply don t work right instal small stack game ugly d version real game lame slide keyboard hurt finger push upper key reviewer say oh way month warranty expire screen start bug slide research find common phone laugh heartily watch youtube guide fix cost part tool time involve mean win t fm radio basically maybe time sure think cool bluetooth slow end software joke obviously digital poison pc thing headphone jack battery crappy music little extra feature cool find real life usage huge pain conclusion foolishly defend phone convince despite s bug quirk get good deal afford need replace phone plus backup call till fail buy good phone apparently,4,0.732,Overall Experience

BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Smartphone - Unlocked - Orange,BLU,115.0,4,"This phone is amazing for the price. You get 1GB RAM and 8GB storage. It is very fast and smooth. Keeps up pretty well on games. Has a truly beautiful HD screen. It runs nearly stock Android Kit Kat. There are no built-in Facebook, BLU or whatever apps.. It's so stock I had to get an app to play Windows Media Player files!It doesn't do LTE, but it runs 4G on AT&T network as long as you put your sim in slot 1. I use GoPhone. It has two full size sim slots. It had the right APN settings from the start. I've been using a Samsung Rugby Pro for my everyday phone, and the BLU seems to run the browser and apps faster. The micro usb charging/data port is on top, which is a little weird. Actually, it allows you to put your phone in a car cup holder while charging without turning it upside down. Not a big issue, but kind of convenient.The lock button is on the right side and volume rocker is on the left. The speaker gets pretty loud playing media, and the earpiece is just loud enough for phone calls. Wi-Fi and bluetooth connectivity are pretty good. BLU even sends you a screen protector, soft case, earbuds, usb charging cable and AC wall adapter.I really enjoyed this phone, until I noticed how quickly the battery drops off. If the phone is just sitting around idle, the battery holds up pretty well. Just checking email or web browsing will cost you significant battery life. Watching videos will drain it faster. I started the day out with 84%, and was down to 15% by 4 or 5 pm. I listened to Spotify for about a half hour in the morning, then listened to the music player for about 50 mintues on bluetooth headphones. The screen was off while I was listening to music of course. I didn't make any long phone calls, and I did a little texting.I know I'm not the first person to complain about the battery. It's a shame, because everything else about this phone is great. It will do everything you would expect out of a budget phone, and do it well. Just make sure you have a charger handy. If this phone had a better battery, it would be hard to beat.I'm going to try the newer model Studio 5.0 C with Android Lollipop and see if that does any better.{{ Update }} I tried the 2015 Studio 5.0 C with Lollipop. While it does have better battery life, it doesn't perform nearly as well as the 5.0 C HD. The new model also has a slightly smaller screen. I have returned both phones now. I wish I would have kept the 5.0 C HD! I'm seriously considering ordering it again. It is asking a lot of a $100 phone to perform well and have good battery life.{{ Update 7/2/15 }} I ordered this phone again, and I am very happy with it. I've been using it for a couple weeks now, and the battery issue isn't as critical as I had thought. If it's fully charged in the morning, it will last you all day with moderate use. I've gotten most of two days out of it a couple times. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid budget phone with a great screen.",2.0,this phone is amazing for the price you get gb ram and gb storage it is very fast and smooth keeps up pretty well on games has a truly beautiful hd screen it runs nearly stock android kit kat there are no built in facebook blu or whatever apps it s so stock i had to get an app to play windows media player files it doesn t do lte but it runs g on at t network as long as you put your sim in slot i use gophone it has two full size sim slots it had the right apn settings from the start i ve been using a samsung rugby pro for my everyday phone and the blu seems to run the browser and apps faster the micro usb charging data port is on top which is a little weird actually it allows you to put your phone in a car cup holder while charging without turning it upside down not a big issue but kind of convenient the lock button is on the right side and volume rocker is on the left the speaker gets pretty loud playing media and the earpiece is just loud enough for phone calls wi fi and bluetooth connectivity are pretty good blu even sends you a screen protector soft case earbuds usb charging cable and ac wall adapter i really enjoyed this phone until i noticed how quickly the battery drops off if the phone is just sitting around idle the battery holds up pretty well just checking email or web browsing will cost you significant battery life watching videos will drain it faster i started the day out with and was down to by or pm i listened to spotify for about a half hour in the morning then listened to the music player for about mintues on bluetooth headphones the screen was off while i was listening to music of course i didn t make any long phone calls and i did a little texting i know i m not the first person to complain about the battery it s a shame because everything else about this phone is great it will do everything you would expect out of a budget phone and do it well just make sure you have a charger handy if this phone had a better battery it would be hard to beat i m going to try the newer model studio c with android lollipop and see if that does any better update i tried the studio c with lollipop while it does have better battery life it doesn t perform nearly as well as the c hd the new model also has a slightly smaller screen i have returned both phones now i wish i would have kept the c hd i m seriously considering ordering it again it is asking a lot of a phone to perform well and have good battery life update i ordered this phone again and i am very happy with it i ve been using it for a couple weeks now and the battery issue isn t as critical as i had thought if it s fully charged in the morning it will last you all day with moderate use i ve gotten most of two days out of it a couple times i would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid budget phone with a great screen,phone amazing price gb ram gb storage fast smooth keep pretty game truly beautiful hd screen run nearly stock android kit kat build facebook blu app s stock app play window medium player file doesn t lte run g t network long sim slot use gophone size sim slot right apn setting start ve samsung rugby pro everyday phone blu run browser app fast micro usb charge datum port little weird actually allow phone car cup holder charge turn upside big issue kind convenient lock button right volume rocker left speaker get pretty loud play medium earpiece loud phone call wi fi bluetooth connectivity pretty good blu send screen protector soft case earbud usb charge cable ac wall adapter enjoy phone notice quickly battery drop phone sit idle battery hold pretty check email web browsing cost significant battery life watch video drain fast start day pm listen spotify half hour morning listen music player mintue bluetooth headphone screen listen music course didn t long phone call little texting know m person complain battery s shame phone great expect budget phone sure charger handy phone well battery hard beat m go try new model studio c android lollipop well update try studio c lollipop well battery life doesn t perform nearly c hd new model slightly small screen return phone wish keep c hd m seriously consider order ask lot phone perform good battery life update order phone happy ve couple week battery issue isn t critical think s fully charge morning day moderate use ve get day couple time recommend look solid budget phone great screen,4,0.695,Overall Experience

The speaker isn't loud, and the corded headset is awkward and earbuds are hard to use. Phone calls work, but I did have to put the watch up to my ear to hear clearly at one point. The Bluetooth range is short approximately 10 feet. It works great through my phone via Bluetooth for music and talk through other Bluetooth speakers that are also sync to my phone. I got a micro sd card and put music on it, it only plays in file manager. Hooked up to a Bluetooth speaker on its own, it skips and sound quality is poor. It's so bad, I now want to return it. This makes it the worst MP3 player I've ever had, considering the wired headphones are very uncomfortable. I haven't tried to pair it with my newer Toyota yet.

Nokia 220 RM-971 Unlocked Cell Phone with 2MP Camera (White),Nokia,179.1,1,"This is a first for me. I have never written a negative review in my life, however this begs to be the exception. First of all, this appears to be a phone aimed primarily at the Caribbean market. The primary language is Spanish on both the box and instructions. There is also an English translation.I did note when researching the phone that there was a video review that noted the back cover was virtually impossible to remove.

Samsung Galaxy S Duos II S7582 DUAL SIM Factory Unlocked International Version - Black,Samsung,299.99,5,"The phone arrived quickly. It was in original packaging, which was, however, opened to include a simple travel adapter to convert the European plug on the cord to American one for US wall sockets. The packaging was carefully closed again with a similar piece of tape, which of course caused some alarm that there was some foul play. No worries, it was just the plug.The phone has a dual slot for the regular sized SIM cards (the so-called mini-sim or 2FF). I have had the phone now a few weeks and it works like a dream. I only needed it as a secondary phone to my heavy duty Samsung Galaxy S 2 Plus and have only installed and used a limited array of applications. I have not had any performance issues with apps or otherwise. I have two European SIM cards in it - for business purposes. Both cards connect very happily sometimes with AT&T and sometimes with T-Mobile. In my relatively modest daily use the battery lasts for about three full days before it needs to be recharged. The only, very mild complaint I can make is that Samsung has introduced a strong contrast to the screen colours of this model. Yes, it makes colours brighter - the ones you can see, but it loses some of the colours in exchange. It is the same problem as with glossy TVs and computer screens. Everything looks bright and shiny, but image quality suffers. As I said, this is a very minor issue - on a phone. I would say that for the price I paid, this phone is truly worth every penny.",34.0,the phone arrived quickly it was in original packaging which was however opened to include a simple travel adapter to convert the european plug on the cord to american one for us wall sockets the packaging was carefully closed again with a similar piece of tape which of course caused some alarm that there was some foul play no worries it was just the plug the phone has a dual slot for the regular sized sim cards the so called mini sim or ff i have had the phone now a few weeks and it works like a dream i only needed it as a secondary phone to my heavy duty samsung galaxy s plus and have only installed and used a limited array of applications i have not had any performance issues with apps or otherwise i have two european sim cards in it for business purposes both cards connect very happily sometimes with at t and sometimes with t mobile in my relatively modest daily use the battery lasts for about three full days before it needs to be recharged the only very mild complaint i can make is that samsung has introduced a strong contrast to the screen colours of this model yes it makes colours brighter the ones you can see but it loses some of the colours in exchange it is the same problem as with glossy tvs and computer screens everything looks bright and shiny but image quality suffers as i said this is a very minor issue on a phone i would say that for the price i paid this phone is truly worth every penny,phone arrive quickly original packaging open include simple travel adapter convert european plug cord american wall socket packaging carefully close similar piece tape course cause alarm foul play worry plug phone dual slot regular sized sim card call mini sim ff phone week work like dream need secondary phone heavy duty samsung galaxy s plus instal limited array application performance issue app european sim card business purpose card connect happily t t mobile relatively modest daily use battery last day need recharge mild complaint samsung introduce strong contrast screen colour model yes make colour brighter one lose colour exchange problem glossy tv computer screen look bright shiny image quality suffer say minor issue phone price pay phone truly worth penny,4,0.475,Overall Experience

BLU Vivo Selfie Smartphone - US GSM Unlocked - Black,BLU,102.56,5,"This is the best smart phone I have bought so far. It is also the third BLU phone I bought. The other two were both studio series and those were worth the money but not great. I am mostly comparing this to the studio 5 HD here since I still have that one and I could compare them side by side. They cost about the same at original price.Best about this: display and size. I have never owned an OLED display device before. The difference is huge - far better than any tablet/phone I have owned before. The contrast is fantastic - I cannot even really see where the display ends and the surrounding starts when the view is black on the edges. On the IPS screen of the studio 5 HD (although pretty good too), you can always see the back-light in a dark or black image - here you cannot.The size is nice too. It is a lot thinner and lighter and slightly smaller than the studio 5 HD while providing the same 720p resolution at a higher pixel density. Processor speed is descent. Also better than the studio (or maybe it is RAM or something else).

If the camera is not a primary need for you, this is an excellent phone and I'd recommend it to anyone.Now if you're interested in a deeper review, here we go.-DesignThe HTC One M8 is, at least in my opinion, one of the best crafted android phones out there, the quality of the materials which is built can be noticed without even touch it, and once you have it in your hand the phone gives the feeling of a premium device, just what you're paying for, since it's not cheap at all.The sleek full aluminum body costs its price in the weight of the phone though, making it one of the heaviest smartphones out there, only comparable with the Sony Xperia Z2; I previously had a Galaxy S4, which is supposed to be way more lighter due to the materials difference, however in my personal experience it's really hard to have a S4 without a case and keep it intact, the plastic can be easily scratched and the material is a fingerprints magnet, so the weight it gains in favor of lighter materials, ends up being gained again for the case. After using the M8 for a month I can say the materials are good enough to not get scratches for normal use, and fingerprints are out of discussion.As a negative point I'd say as many others, the space in the front of the logo is completely unnecessary and only adds some dead height to the phone, however you can still navigate through all of the screen with a hand in most of situations with ease.In my personal opinion, the decision about putting the power button in the top at the phone is more than accurate, I lost count on how many times I turned screen on with my previous phone while I was putting in into the pocket cause I accidentally touched the button on the edge while holding it, this combined with the gestures to unlock the screen makes you forget about the lock button, which not makes it uncomfortable in the end.-ScreenThe M8 screen it's a beautiful screen, I was a bit worried about this cause I was used to the AMOLED displays from Samsung, but once used this one for a while I should say, in my personal opinion is way more better, because color saturation is more accurate to natural tones, except for some green tones, I don't know if it's because all of the time I've spent with AMOLED screens, but they seem way bright in the M8 screen, the first time was uncomfortable and still don't like how do they seem at all. An example of these green tones are present in the google play store in the apps and games buttons, I'll add some images later from the phone so you can appreciate it.In terms of brightness the M8 has a good brightness scale: the lowest brightness is enough to light the screen while you're reading in the dark without being annoying, and the highest one is too bright for my personal like in normal light situations (cause I don't like high brightness in my screens anyway) but it's enough to be able to watch the content of the screen against direct sunlight, which I appreciate a lot considering in the same conditions with my previous phone I was just able to see some purple brights most of the time.The automatic brightness could be improved later, looks so close to the highest brightness for my personal likes.-CameraThis was one of the things that kept me skeptical about the phone cause I heard a lot of complains about the first HTC One and the Ultra Pixel technology, so I was expecting ugly and blurry photos. I'm not a huge fan of photos and I don't take a lot of them with the phone, maybe I'm not the best person to make a review from it, but the ones I've taken seems fair enough for me, the colors are good, the camera is fast and results are decent. Off course, it has the limitations of what every 4 pixel camera (being ultra or mega pixel) could have, and it's the lack of detail and sharpness as soon as you start zooming the photo. However if you're gonna take pics just for selfies, casual food hipster photos and to send some images from whatsapp or facebook (which in whatsapp case are resized anyway) the quality of the photos are good enough, there is very detailed reviews about this at Internet if you need more info about it.Duo camera bring some interesting effects, some more polished than others, the most interesting for many people, ufocus, actually works, but it's not the most polished of them, I have to say in some situations the area is not well defined, but for general purpose will behave as you expect most of times.If it's true more mega pixels doesn't fully means a better camera, it's also true this one still lacks of the minimum required amount of pixels to be at pair with his competitors, I hope they find a way to add more pixels to the camera, this would make cover the weakest point of this phone.-AudioThis topic is with no doubt one of the shiniest for HTC, last year's One was way more ahead from the rest, and this year they've done it again. Frontal double speakers sacrifices some height from the phone, making it as tall as other with bigger screens, but the sound quality is out of discussion. This year Sony got close by bringing their speaker to the front as well which improved the audio, but I think HTC is still better, and I've seen some serious audio reviews which also thinks so, but in the end it's a personal preference, none of them are perfect.-Memory and BatterySince I was using the S4, I've never been able to fill up the memory, cause I tend to close what I'm not using, I'm not the most memory demanding user over there. If you feel like fitting in my profile, 2GB of RAM should be enough for you, and maybe most of people, since in the end few manufacturers gave the jump into the 3GB scale. I've been using around 10 apps in the background with no weird behaviors, everything works as expected.Before talking about battery duration let's define my usage patterns: daily usage includes web browsing, reading books and news, checking mail, social networks and sometimes playing some 3D games, which makes me a kind of heavy user.The battery was one of the things that impressed me more from this phone. My previous phone had a 2600 mAh, which used to last in average more than 3 and less than 4 hours of screen on before battery runs out, sometimes I was close to the 4 hours, in terms of hours without having to charge the phone that meant 8-10 hours on the heaviest use I gave it, 12 average and having power saving options on except for processor one, 14-16 on light use and around 20 hours using power saving additional options, being that the record I got with that phone.The HTC One M8 comes with a 2600 mAh battery too, in terms of screen on hours before the battery runs out, it lasts in average more than 5 hours and less than 6 and I've passed the 6 hours sometimes. In terms of hours without charging the phone, that's around 14 hours on heavy usage, 16-24 hours on lighter usage and up to 40 hours on weekends when I use the phone the less, without using any power saving option, and being my current record on this one. This 'no power savings' statement is a bit tricky though, cause the HTC One M8 turns power saving settings automatically when battery is lower than 15%, however if you consider my previous phone had them always on, it's a huge step forward for the same battery capacity, and this is where the optimization from title comes from.-SoftwareHTC sense is extremely non intrusive personalization layer,is fast, fluid and minimalist. The applications have these same patterns and tend to add some color to the equation (not so many for application though) this can be a good or bad thing, that depends on your likes, I'll add some screenshots of the apps later. I won't add benchmarks test to talk about performance cause they've been tricked some generations ago, but in normal use around this month I haven't experienced any heavy lag, or delay which makes the phone uncomfortable to use. The phone is fast, you can feel the difference between the sanpdragon 600 and the 800 series, it executes everything smoothly.Saying there's a phone with no lag at all anytime is a beautiful lie, I've seen random lags, freezes and delays even in iPhones; this is not the perfect phone, however they barely happen, at least with the time I've been using it and with the usage I've been making of it, you can't compare it to TouchWiz, that's miles ahead in terms of lag and delay competition, even if that's not a good thing.A real downside and a bad thing of this non intrusive UI I've found is, however, the lack of a default file explorer. Android doesn't has any, and HTC won't include anyone either. If you don't use a SD card in your phone that won't be any deal, you just need to pick the one you like more from the Play Store (there are a lot, with beautiful and polished UI and a lot of people make their default from there anyway), but if you have a SD card this will mean some problems and uncomfortable situations for you; since Android 4.4 Google restricted the SD card write access to only Google apps and the third party applications installed by the manufacturer, so not having a preset one or a google provided one, you won't be able to modify anything from the SD card without connecting the phone to a PC. This can be solved with root privileges, but if you understand what that means and the consequences it has, you'll understand that's a decision you need to make and prolly HTC won't like it if you need to claim your warranty.-MiscellaneousSomething I didn't like from this phone and I liked more from my previous one that it's not covered in everywhere else, is the notification LED. This one has only 3 colors: red when battery's low, green when it's fully charged, and an orange-like for everything else; maybe there's a setting to change this, or you could use an third party application for it, but so far I haven't found any setting.-ConclusionThe HTC One M8 is an excellent piece of engineering, nicely crafted with a good performance and optimization, which however has some flaws that can be improved, some by software, and some will need to be taken in consideration, hopefully, for the next generation's model, and if you're reading the conclusion after reading the review, we can conclude you're a very patient person :)Thanks for your time, hope this turns out to be helpful for you!",7.0,after a month of use of the phone i can resume it in few words in case you

"Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900A GSM Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Blue",samsung,172.0,1,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a fantastic phone, but the one I received from this seller was defective. I didn't find out until after it was activated, so this presents a big problem for me. The problem is that the it won't charge the battery. The first time it charged the battery to 40% and that is when I had to take it to the AT&T store to get it activated. When I returned home, I put it back on charge and let it charge for a couple of hours before I returned to get it. The phone was not charging, and it was 1% changed. I reset the phone and it charged again, when it got to 30%, I installed the update. I thought the update might fix the charging problem. After the update, the phone was reset while it finished installing, that all went fine. I saw that the phone was charging so I left it on the charger and went o sleep. When I returned, 7 hours later, it had stopped charging, and the phone was charged to 19%. So all the problems with the phone have to do with the charging. I also tried the finger print scanner as a method to unlock the phone, but after it was trained, it took way to many tries to get it to read my finger correctly. It was a good thing that the phone had a backup password that could bypass the finger print. I don't know if I should order another one of these phones, I am pretty sure they are refurbished phones, but they avoid saying that in the description.",12.0,the samsung galaxy s is a fantastic phone but the one i received from this seller was defective i didn t find out until after it was activated so this presents a big problem for me the problem is that the it won t charge the battery the first time it charged the battery to and that is when i had to take it to the at t store to get it activated when i returned home i put it back on charge and let it charge for a couple of hours before i returned to get it the phone was not charging and it was changed i reset the phone and it charged again when it got to i installed the update i thought the update might fix the charging problem after the update the phone was reset while it finished installing that all went fine i saw that the phone was charging so i left it on the charger and went o sleep when i returned hours later it had stopped charging and the phone was charged to so all the problems with the phone have to do with the charging i also tried the finger print scanner as a method to unlock the phone but after it was trained it took way to many tries to get it to read my finger correctly it was a good thing that the phone had a backup password that could bypass the finger print i don t know if i should order another one of these phones i am pretty sure they are refurbished phones but they avoid saying that in the description,samsung galaxy s fantastic phone receive seller defective didn t find activate present big problem problem win t charge battery time charge battery t store activate return home charge let charge couple hour return phone charge change reset phone charge get instal update think update fix charge problem update phone reset finish instal go fine see phone charge leave charger go o sleep return hour later stop charge phone charge problem phone charging try finger print scanner method unlock phone train take way try read finger correctly good thing phone backup password bypass finger print don t know order phone pretty sure refurbish phone avoid say description,2,0.552,Camera Quality

"5.5"" Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Blue",JUNING,99.99,5," This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion.",10.0,this phone is a very pretty looking phone it offers a slim profile however still great battery length the quality is great i was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers i have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features it s not a tacky gold color it don t appear cheap it s actually more of a flat yet metallic look the phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn t heavy the battery sim card slot and sd slot are very easy to access and use for me this is very beneficial as i have to swap batteries often since i have to be on mobile web many hours a day i often have to store photos and files on the sd cards for work i also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well this phone made things more convenient for me the next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering i tether often with work and home life i live in a town where the internet is very slow and when i turn my tethering on i can accomplish all my tasks faster than if i had just used my home wifi the phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs if your a busy person on the run like i am these features are lifesavers i often have to swap back and forth between four apps and use many internet pages all day long the fast tabs stop you from typing in urls incorrectly this phone helps me in both my personal and work life the phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone i use the battery life seems to last longer as well i really enjoy this phone i ve enclosed a video to see the features of the phone i would recommend this phone i received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion,phone pretty look phone offer slim profile great battery length quality great satisfied video sound phone offer color phone favorite feature s tacky gold color don t appear cheap s actually flat metallic look phone comfortable hold definitely isn t heavy battery sim card slot sd slot easy access use beneficial swap battery mobile web hour day store photo file sd card work flip sim card phone work phone thing convenient favorite feature hot spot tether tether work home life live town internet slow turn tethering accomplish task fast home wifi phone comes preloade app quick load tab busy person run like feature lifesaver swap forth app use internet page day long fast tab stop type url incorrectly phone help personal work life phone hold signal well prepaid phone use battery life long enjoy phone ve enclose video feature phone recommend phone receive phone free reduce rate exchange honest opinion,4,0.646,Overall Experience

Nokia Lumia 1520 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows Smartphone w/ 20MP Camera & PureView Technology - Yellow (No Warranty),Nokia,145.49,1,"This is my second Nokia Lumia 1520. The first was purchased through Amazon with an AT&T contract and worked well for the two years that I had it. The screen got cracked and the cost to replace was $129.99, so I decided to just buy a new phone rather than replace the screen considering the phone was already 2 years old so I assumed the battery life would start to diminish and considering that I only paid $99 with contract for the phone. I was reluctant to purchase an unlocked phone as I had never purchased an unlocked phone before and worried that it would not be the same quality as my prior phone. My concern was well-founded as this phone has been a complete piece of garbage from day 1. Everyone complains that they cannot hear me on this phone. Odd as I bought the exact same phone as my prior and had no prior complaints. Even tried using it without my shock guard, but same complaints from every single caller. Thus, I could only use the phone with Bluetooth or on speaker phone. As I loved my prior phone so much, I dealt with it, until this morning. My husband came to wake me up asking whether I had intended to oversleep. I shot out of bed and checked my phone only to discover that it died over night 60 days after I purchased it. Last night before bed, I set my alarm as I always do, plugged in my phone and went to sleep. This morning, nada. The screen is on, but the unlock button will not unlock the phone. I tried to reboot, but I cannot. I plugged the phone into my computer with the hope that I would be able to do a restore, but my computer does not acknowledge that it is there even though the phone lights up when I plug it in. My Bluetooth will not connect even though it worked yesterday. Thus, rendering my phone useless. I have contacted the seller in the hopes that, perhaps, I just received a bum phone and am hopeful they will respond appropriately.",3.0,this is my second nokia lumia the first was purchased through amazon with an at t contract and worked well for the two years that i had it the screen got cracked and the cost to replace was so i decided to just buy a new phone rather than replace the screen considering the phone was already years old so i assumed the battery life would start to diminish and considering that i only paid with contract for the phone i was reluctant to purchase an unlocked phone as i had never purchased an unlocked phone before and worried that it would not be the same quality as my prior phone my concern was well founded as this phone has been a complete piece of garbage from day everyone complains that they cannot hear me on this phone odd as i bought the exact same phone as my prior and had no prior complaints even tried using it without my shock guard but same complaints from every single caller thus i could only use the phone with bluetooth or on speaker phone as i loved my prior phone so much i dealt with it until this morning my husband came to wake me up asking whether i had intended to oversleep i shot out of bed and checked my phone only to discover that it died over night days after i purchased it last night before bed i set my alarm as i always do plugged in my phone and went to sleep this morning nada the screen is on but the unlock button will not unlock the phone i tried to reboot but i cannot i plugged the phone into my computer with the hope that i would be able to do a restore but my computer does not acknowledge that it is there even though the phone lights up when i plug it in my bluetooth will not connect even though it worked yesterday thus rendering my phone useless i have contacted the seller in the hopes that perhaps i just received a bum phone and am hopeful they will respond appropriately,second nokia lumia purchase amazon t contract work year screen get crack cost replace decide buy new phone replace screen consider phone year old assume battery life start diminish consider pay contract phone reluctant purchase unlocked phone purchase unlocked phone worry quality prior phone concern found phone complete piece garbage day complain hear phone odd buy exact phone prior prior complaint try shock guard complaint single caller use phone bluetooth speaker phone love prior phone deal morning husband come wake ask intend oversleep shoot bed check phone discover die night day purchase night bed set alarm plug phone go sleep morning nada screen unlock button unlock phone try reboot plug phone computer hope able restore computer acknowledge phone light plug bluetooth connect work yesterday render phone useless contact seller hope receive bum phone hopeful respond appropriately,2,0.732,Camera Quality

After I had this cell phone, I have not touch my IPAD for weeks, the display is crispy and refined. Once you have this phone you don't need TV, radio, notebook, e-book reader, gps camera etc, etc, if replaced everything and is easy to use. Oh, I take it back, only other electric device I am still using is my computer since it got a keyboard for easy input. Thank to the 4G data and T-Mible's unlimited data package, I watch video's on Youtube for hours. The HD video display is great. I turn on music why I am driving. The navigation (google map) works great. If the traffic is bad on your way home, the phone will give you an notification before you hit the road(I know this is a google thing but it is preinstalled and work so covenient!), when you driving it will dynamically promote an new Route if the real time traffic condition getting better, that alone save me from stuck in high way for many times.The camera is OK, i have no complain. but the video shooting is awesome, it is very crispy, HD video. I am very glad I bought this phone some that I have some loving moment saved in HD video format including my daughter building her very first snowman(which help from dady of cause! :D )The battery is great! If I forgot to charge is for one day, won't be a big problem, for normal use it can generally hold for two days. But it you used it like your computer for 8 hours straight video and internet or so, it probably can only last a day and half. but it is way better than my wife's iPhone. It also has a energy saving mode that if your battery is too low, it will turn off all other things only left phone and short messenger on, that will be life saver if you are in middle of nowhere and your battery is low.The finger print recognition is GREAT, I literally forgot my password to the phone because I never have to use it to turn on or unlock the phone, just use finger tips, Just make sure you have your finger print saved for your both pointer so you can use either one of you hand tounlock it. I also save my wife and my kid's finger print so they can used the phone too.Cons: Nothing is perfect, I did notice few problems: 1. Some app simply not run, when I try to start it just say"" Unfortutenatly the ""xxxApp"" has stopped, I have no idea what the issue is. probably an compatibility issue? so far I only encountered one or two apps(I have about 100 apps on the phone). I can live with it. 2. the screen is huge, so it could be a problem for single hand operation, I use right hand, which make app on upper left corner un- reachable if I try use phone on one hand only, I rearrange the apps so that the app I need when I use singer hand operation is all located on the right - lower part of the screen.",6.0,absolutely love the big screen after i had this cell phone i have not touch my ipad for weeks the display is crispy and refined once you have this phone you don t need tv radio notebook e book reader gps camera etc etc if replaced everything and is easy to use oh i take it back only other electric device i am still using is my computer since it got a keyboard for easy input thank to the g data and t mible s unlimited data package i watch video s on youtube for hours the hd video display is great i turn on music why i am driving the navigation google map works great if the traffic is bad on your way home the phone will give you an notification before you hit the road i know this is a google thing but it is preinstalled and work so covenient when you driving it will dynamically promote an new route if the real time traffic condition getting better that alone save me from stuck in high way for many times the camera is ok i have no complain but the video shooting is awesome it is very crispy hd video i am very glad i bought this phone some that i have some loving moment saved in hd video format including my daughter building her very first snowman which help from dady of cause d the battery is great if i forgot to charge is for one day won t be a big problem for normal use it can generally hold for two days but it you used it like your computer for hours straight video and internet or so it probably can only last a day and half but it is way better than my wife s iphone it also has a energy saving mode that if your battery is too low it will turn off all other things only left phone and short messenger on that will be life saver if you are in middle of nowhere and your battery is low the finger print recognition is great i literally forgot my password to the phone because i never have to use it to turn on or unlock the phone just use finger tips just make sure you have your finger print saved for your both pointer so you can use either one of you hand tounlock it i also save my wife and my kid s finger print so they can used the phone too cons nothing is perfect i did notice few problems some app simply not run when i try to start it just say unfortutenatly the xxxapp has stopped i have no idea what the issue is probably an compatibility issue so far i only encountered one or two apps i have about apps on the phone i can live with it the screen is huge so it could be a problem for single hand operation i use right hand which make app on upper left corner un reachable if i try use phone on one hand only i rearrange the apps so that the app i need when i use singer hand operation is all located on the right lower part of the screen,absolutely love big screen cell phone touch ipad week display crispy refine phone don t need tv radio notebook e book reader gps camera etc etc replace easy use oh electric device computer get keyboard easy input thank g datum t mible s unlimited data package watch video s youtube hour hd video display great turn music drive navigation google map work great traffic bad way home phone notification hit road know google thing preinstalle work covenient drive dynamically promote new route real time traffic condition get well save stuck high way time camera ok complain video shooting awesome crispy hd video glad buy phone love moment save hd video format include daughter build snowman help dady cause d battery great forgot charge day won t big problem normal use generally hold day like computer hour straight video internet probably day half way well wife s iphone energy save mode battery low turn thing leave phone short messenger life saver middle battery low finger print recognition great literally forget password phone use turn unlock phone use finger tip sure finger print save pointer use hand tounlock save wife kid s finger print phone con perfect notice problem app simply run try start unfortutenatly xxxapp stop idea issue probably compatibility issue far encounter app app phone live screen huge problem single hand operation use right hand app upper left corner un reachable try use phone hand rearrange app app need use singer hand operation locate right low screen,4,0.805,Overall Experience

Although, I never did receive the ""protective case"" as advertised on Amazon.So, I purchased a second one believing that reviews actually do something and the new one would work or at least I would know how to fix it. Well, IT WAS NOT FIXED AND WORSE YET THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS DIDN'T WORK EITHER. SO FRUSTRATING. The review below still reflects my review:I really want this phone to be a FIVE STAR review(as I had enjoyed my Cyprus 6001,which I dropped and cracked the screen) but unfortunately there are three reasons why I can't:1.) First thing in the packaging there was no protective case. There was a screen protector but instead of a case there was a second back plate to the phone( I checked the product number on the original and second back plates to confirm this). 2.) It is constantly ""timing out"" when accessing the internet, this is extremely frustrating and delaying my setup as I can't download my apps nor access information I am looking for, it is a crap shoot. 3.) Finally and most importantly, it is supposed to be a 4G and yet it is only showing 3G and when I go to mobile network settings there are none for 4G. I love verykool for its features and functionality but these are problems that will not allow me to give a high rating and I am feeling like I was sold one thing and then delivered something else.

Initial start up/boot was very slow but after use start up has become quicker. It is more than enough storage for me but does also have the option to add more or input a 2nd sim. Allows control over which sim you're using (can also use both) and which you incur data from, very neat. Upon initial camera use I was not satisfied due to having to adjust the settings manually (I am not a photographer and don't have much experience in this). After messing around with it a bit it does have pretty great picture quality. The fingerprint reader has not failed me once, successful on each attempt and I have 4 fingers uploaded (few days use, as well as purposefully shutting on/off to test this).Some things that have me iffy about keeping the phone (and I'm hoping someone reads this and can offer some input). Any white screens, such as the stock messaging app or going into settings, comes off very fuzzy for me. I'm still able to read the text and it's for the most part clear and crisp, it just looks fuzzy or more so like there is dust under the screen.

Yezz Andy 3.5E - Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White/Blue,Yezz,36.0,2,"At first I loved this phone. It's cute, compact, and as an Android device had way more apps than my old Nokia Windows phone. However, as other people have shared it has a very small amount of memory. This didn't deter me until I recently got a micro SD card here off Amazon fairly cheap. The problem was this phone refused to mount it! I tried formatting it on my laptop and a whole bunch of other troubleshooting but narrowed it down to the phone simply not accepting it. I read up on some issues with the version of KitKat running and SD cards but my problem was this phone didn't even recognize I had one to begin with...the slots kinda wonky so there is that. The SD card worked fine on that laptop and guess what, my old Windows phone. A lot of memory kept being used up despite my best efforts to clear up space. I got rid of so much clutter and apps but by the end of every day it would tell me no more room. Now, I'm not the most smartphone educated person here so take this as you will but it became too much of a hassle on my part to keep using this phone. There were other navigation issues I had simply from confusion and I have looked at the Yezz ""manual"" (downloaded onto the phone and online...kind of. Not very in depth.) but was still lost with a lot of things. More minuscule issues had to do with the camera. To put it bluntly, it's of poor quality. I downloaded apps to add filters and was ok with it but to be honest I don't have a camera so my phone replaces it. I love to travel so I like to have good quality photos and that Windows phone had this beat. If you do buy this phone and don't live in Latin America, make sure you set it up to the correct country of your provider otherwise you can't make calls. I learned that the hard way lol.

Nokia Lumia 920 RM-821 32GB Black Windows 8 Smartphone 4G LTE (GSM Factory Unlocked),Nokia,79.95,4,"Had a big scare with this phone, which is why I am taking 1 star off. When I turned it on all I could see was a red screen with a white Nokia logo at the top. Being new to WP8 I waited, and waited, did some research online, to no avail, did a soft reset, a hard reset. Nothing but a red screen. Had to go the Nokia website to download the Recovery Program, which for some reason was hard to install, run and make it work on my Windows 8 laptop (at first would not let me install it because W8 thought it was suspicious... doesn't Microsoft own Nokia now??, then the program wouldn't find the phone, then the download would stop after a few seconds or minutes but eventually finished - WAY TOO HARD!), but eventually I was able to re-install the OS and it started. Been working fine since then.Coming from years as an iPhone owner, there are some good and some less good. And WP 8.1 is coming so that should make things better. I am missing some apps but found some decent new ones.Battery is better than on my iPhone 5. Battery saver is useful, so is the ability to block some apps from running in the background.Screen is gorgeous, but that phone is a brick. Geesh, it's heavy. No case on that one!Dedicated phone button works well to wake up the phone and take a pic, but that process is far from quick, takes a few seconds.I have AT&T by the way.Was able to sync music from iTunes on my Mac (only non-DRM songs).Some odd things.

LG Electronics G3 D855 32GB Unlocked International Phone (International Version No Warranty) - Retail Packaging - Violet,LG Electronics,561.11,5,"The G3 is one of my favorite phones I have ever owned. The look and solid feel are second only to a handful of phones. I've had both variants of the d855 and can say without a doubt, you want to get the 32 gigabyte version, as the extra RAM and space are very necessary. The screen is the shining star here.. Once you get used to it all 1080p screens look outdated and cheap (minus sony's z2, z3 screens.. they looks great at 1080p)I have bought (all outright, full price) a droid turbo, htc one m7, sony xperia z2, blu life pure mini, oneplus one, iPhone 5c, lg g2, and a couple others.. and the G3 is my daily driver. I am replacing it with a Note 4, but not for any reason other than I want a phone with a fingerprint scanner and big 2k screen. The 32GB G3 bought now at these prices (so LOW) will be a fine device for atlas another year, maybe even two, that will be as quick as most everything else out there.The Bad: this is the intl. version, so NO 4G in the USA. mine is plenty fast on H w/ AT&T but this may really bug some people. The one issue I always have had with the phone personally though was the SoC. The SD 801AC is a beast of an SoC and paired with the Adreno 330, it halls balls. BUT, it wasn't quite ready to power a 2k screen AND handle heavy multitasking/gaming. So from the get-go you'll notice ""micro-lags"" all over the place. You do get used to it, and it's nothing to noteworthy, but it is there. And when you start really throwing a lot of tasks at the phone you'll see screen stutters quite a bit. My first g3 from amazon (the 16gig) had AWFUL sound from the AUX port.. I mean bad. On my new g3 (the 32 gig) the sound couldn't be better. Loud and clear.. its Apple quality. So I chalk up the bad experience on my first one to a bad device.I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a flagship, with 2k screen.. but doesn't want to spend a ton of money outright. And unless you do a ton of Youtube on your mobile data plan, the lack of LTE will go unnoticed for the most part.If you can afford to spend and extra $100 get the Galaxy Note 4",0.0,the g is one of my favorite phones i have ever owned the look and solid feel are second only to a handful of phones i ve had both variants of the d and can say without a doubt you want to get the gigabyte version as the extra ram and space are very necessary the screen is the shining star here once you get used to it all p screens look outdated and cheap minus sony s z z screens they looks great at p i have bought all outright full price a droid turbo htc one m sony xperia z blu life pure mini oneplus one iphone c lg g and a couple others and the g is my daily driver i am replacing it with a note but not for any reason other than i want a phone with a fingerprint scanner and big k screen the gb g bought now at these prices so low will be a fine device for atlas another year maybe even two that will be as quick as most everything else out there the bad this is the intl version so no g in the usa mine is plenty fast on h w at t but this may really bug some people the one issue i always have had with the phone personally though was the soc the sd ac is a beast of an soc and paired with the adreno it halls balls but it wasn t quite ready to power a k screen and handle heavy multitasking gaming so from the get go you ll notice micro lags all over the place you do get used to it and it s nothing to noteworthy but it is there and when you start really throwing a lot of tasks at the phone you ll see screen stutters quite a bit my first g from amazon the gig had awful sound from the aux port i mean bad on my new g the gig the sound couldn t be better loud and clear its apple quality so i chalk up the bad experience on my first one to a bad device i would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a flagship with k screen but doesn t want to spend a ton of money outright and unless you do a ton of youtube on your mobile data plan the lack of lte will go unnoticed for the most part if you can afford to spend and extra get the galaxy note,g favorite phone own look solid feel second handful phone ve variant d doubt want gigabyte version extra ram space necessary screen shin star p screen look outdated cheap minus sony s z z screen look great p buy outright price droid turbo htc m sony xperia z blu life pure mini oneplus iphone c lg g couple g daily driver replace note reason want phone fingerprint scanner big k screen gb g buy price low fine device atlas year maybe quick bad intl version g usa plenty fast h w t bug people issue phone personally soc sd ac beast soc pair adreno hall ball wasn t ready power k screen handle heavy multitasking gaming ll notice micro lag place s noteworthy start throw lot task phone ll screen stutter bit g amazon gig awful sound aux port mean bad new g gig sound couldn t well loud clear apple quality chalk bad experience bad device recommend phone want flagship k screen doesn t want spend ton money outright ton youtube mobile datum plan lack lte unnoticed afford spend extra galaxy note,4,0.536,Overall Experience

"LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smart Phone, 5.2"" Ice Blue, 32GB Storage, US Warranty",LG Electronics,325.0,2,"I actually like this phone - I would've given the phone an overall 4 star - it's light weight, sturdy and solid in feel. The back texture is smooth but grippy, and doesn't seem prone to the normal oil degradation that occurs with most rubberized paints. The operating system is Android 6, Marshmallow, and really enjoyable to use. The camera is decent, doesn't top my old Nokia Lumia, (single) speaker is extremely loud and clear. The phone does get hot when in charge and watching videos. The battery life is medium, I could expect about 2-3 days of standby in a good coverage/wifi area - any other time i can drop to less than 3/4 of a day.Now, the reason for the 2 stars - having owned this phone for less than a month, the phone decides to crap out. Touch screen doesn't work in certain areas, left side/all of the screen is distorted with bars. I included a picture - that's not from the camera folks, that's probably from some blow capacitor in the device. I was hoping i'd have a trouble free experience, maybe for at least 90 days. This is only my second LG electronic item I purchased, the first one being a monitor and great, sold off and don't know the current condition, but I was not surprised this happened, given the low price of the phone and the reputation of the Goldstar company.
